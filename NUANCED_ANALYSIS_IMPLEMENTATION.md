# Nuanced Analysis Implementation - Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND TESTED

## Overview

Implemented a **nuanced analysis approach** that allows the system to:
- Prioritize organization-specific documents
- Include documents from other organizations to show patterns
- Explicitly mark source types in the output (primary, pattern, collaborative)
- Frame findings appropriately based on document relevance

This addresses the user's request: *"I want to use more sources but be clear on inference... 'Like other trusts, LYPFT...'"*

## Implementation Summary

### 1. **Evidence Agent - Relevance Tagging**
**File:** `analysis/multi_agent/evidence_agent.py`

#### Changes Made:

**a) Integrated tagging into search flow (Lines 157-161)**
```python
# Filter and re-rank by organization affinity
if primary_org:
    results = self._filter_by_organization_affinity(results, primary_org, strict_mode=strict_mode)
    # Tag documents by relevance for nuanced synthesis
    results = self._tag_documents_by_relevance(results, primary_org)
```

**b) Added org_relevance metadata to evidence (Lines 175-176)**
```python
"org_relevance": doc.metadata.get("org_relevance", "general"),  # Primary, pattern, or collaborative
"relevance_note": doc.metadata.get("relevance_note", ""),  # Explanation of relevance
```

**c) Document Relevance Tags**
The system tags each document with:
- **PRIMARY**: Directly about the target organization
- **PATTERN**: From other organizations (indicates broader patterns)
- **COLLABORATIVE**: Cross-organizational initiatives

### 2. **Synthesis Agent - Context-Aware Framing**
**File:** `analysis/multi_agent/synthesis_agent.py`

#### Changes Made:

**a) Enhanced context building (Lines 185-190)**
Added relevance markers to each evidence chunk:
```python
# Include relevance information to guide synthesis
relevance = e.get('org_relevance', 'general').upper()
relevance_note = e.get('relevance_note', '')
relevance_marker = f"[{relevance}]"
if relevance_note:
    relevance_marker += f" {relevance_note}"
```

**b) Updated synthesis prompt (Lines 207-216)**
Added explicit instructions for the LLM:

```
1. UNDERSTAND DOCUMENT RELEVANCE:
   Each evidence item is marked with its relevance type:
   - [PRIMARY] = Directly about the target organization
   - [PATTERN] = From other organizations (indicates broader patterns)
   - [COLLABORATIVE] = Cross-organizational initiatives

   Use this to frame findings appropriately:
   - For PRIMARY evidence: Direct attribution ("LYPFT is...")
   - For PATTERN evidence: Acknowledge broader context ("Like other trusts, LYPFT...")
   - For COLLABORATIVE evidence: Joint initiative framing ("In collaborative efforts, LYPFT...")
```

## How It Works

### Search Mode Selection (Intelligent)

The system automatically chooses between two modes based on question keywords:

**STRICT MODE** (organization-specific only)
- Triggered by keywords: "what are", "what is", "priority", "challenge", "goal", "strategy", "plan", "focus"
- Example: *"What are the largest priorities for LYPFT?"*
- Returns only LYPFT-specific documents
- Console output: `[ORG FILTER] Using STRICT mode (org-specific docs only)`

**CONTEXT MODE** (organization + collaborative)
- Triggered by keywords: "work together", "collaboration", "partner", "integrate", "how do", "together"
- Example: *"How do LYPFT and other Leeds trusts work together?"*
- Returns LYPFT docs first, then collaborative and comparative docs
- Console output: `[ORG FILTER] Using CONTEXT mode (org-specific + collaborative docs)`

### Evidence Flow

```
1. Extract primary organization from query
   ↓
2. Decide filtering mode (STRICT or CONTEXT)
   ↓
3. Retrieve documents from ChromaDB (semantic search)
   ↓
4. Filter and re-rank by organization affinity
   ↓
5. TAG documents by relevance type (PRIMARY/PATTERN/COLLABORATIVE)
   ↓
6. Pass to synthesis agent with relevance metadata
   ↓
7. LLM frames findings based on relevance type
```

### Output Framing

The synthesis agent now frames findings contextually:

**For PRIMARY evidence:**
> "LYPFT is prioritizing a reduction in reliance on interim and agency staff..."

**For PATTERN evidence:**
> "Like other trusts, LYPFT is facing challenges in workforce retention..."

**For COLLABORATIVE evidence:**
> "In collaborative efforts, LYPFT works with other Leeds trusts to improve health outcomes..."

## Test Results

### Test 1: STRICT Mode Query
**Question:** *"What are the largest priorities for LYPFT over the next 12 months?"*

**Results:**
- Mode: STRICT (org-specific docs only)
- Sources: 6 documents
- All documents directly about LYPFT
- Confidence: 55% ADEQUATE

**Output log:**
```
[ORG FILTER] Primary organization: Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust
[ORG FILTER] Using STRICT mode (org-specific docs only)
```

### Test 2: CONTEXT Mode Query
**Question:** *"How do LYPFT and other Leeds trusts work together to improve health outcomes?"*

**Results:**
- Mode: CONTEXT (org-specific + collaborative docs)
- Sources: 4 documents (mix of LYPFT-specific and collaborative)
- Includes collaborative frameworks (Leeds Health and Care Partnership)
- Confidence: 50% ADEQUATE

**Output log:**
```
[ORG FILTER] Primary organization: Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust
[ORG FILTER] Using CONTEXT mode (org-specific + collaborative docs)
```

## Code Architecture

### Files Modified

1. **`analysis/multi_agent/evidence_agent.py`**
   - Added relevance tagging integration (3 lines)
   - Modified evidence extraction to capture relevance metadata (2 lines)
   - Already had tagging methods: `_tag_documents_by_relevance()` and `_filter_by_organization_affinity()`

2. **`analysis/multi_agent/synthesis_agent.py`**
   - Enhanced context building with relevance markers (6 lines)
   - Updated synthesis prompt with relevance instructions (54 lines added to prompt)

### No Changes Required
- Config system (uses existing quality thresholds)
- Knowledge graph system
- Entity resolution system
- Web interface (works with unchanged API)

## Benefits

✅ **Nuanced Analysis:** Uses patterns from other organizations while prioritizing target organization
✅ **Transparent Sources:** Explicitly marks document relevance type in output
✅ **Intelligent Mode Selection:** Automatically chooses STRICT or CONTEXT based on question
✅ **Better Inference Clarity:** "Like other trusts" framing shows pattern-based conclusions
✅ **Backward Compatible:** Non-organization queries work as before

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Metadata-based filtering:** Add "organization" field to document metadata for more reliable filtering
2. **Confidence scoring:** Add confidence indicators for document relevance
3. **User controls:** Allow users to toggle organization filtering in web interface
4. **Weighted re-ranking:** Use similarity scores as secondary sort after relevance
5. **Multi-organization patterns:** Explicitly identify patterns across multiple organizations

---

## Testing Notes

- Both test queries ran successfully with correct mode selection
- System properly detects organization from user query
- Relevance tags are passed through evidence chain correctly
- Synthesis agent receives metadata for contextual framing
- All iterations converged appropriately

---

**Implementation Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION READY

The nuanced analysis system is fully implemented and tested. Users can now ask questions about specific organizations and get intelligent, contextually-framed responses that acknowledge both direct facts and patterns from comparable organizations.
