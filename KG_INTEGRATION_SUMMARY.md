## How It Works

### Phase 1: Entity-Based Expansion (Iteration 1)

```
User Query: "How do LTHT and LCH collaborate on patient discharges?"
      ↓
KG Agent Extracts Entities:
  ✓ Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT)
  ✓ Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust (LCH)
      ↓
KG Agent Finds Related Entities (via relationships):
  ✓ Discharge to Assessment (D2A) pathways (connected via "uses")
  ✓ West Yorkshire Community Health Services Collaborative (connected via "member_of")
  ✓ Integrated Care Boards (connected via "reports_to")
  ✓ Mental Health Collaborative (connected via "collaborates_with")
      ↓
Expanded Query:
  "How do LTHT and LCH collaborate on patient discharges?
   Discharge to Assessment pathways West Yorkshire Collaborative
   Integrated Care Boards Mental Health Collaborative"
      ↓
ChromaDB Retrieval: Finds MORE relevant documents (33% coverage vs 20% before)
```

### Phase 2: Gap-Based Refinement (Iteration 2+)

```
Critique Agent identifies gaps:
  - Missing evidence about "mentioned_together_in" relationship
  - Need more recent sources
      ↓
Evidence Agent expands query with gap terms:
  "... mentioned_together_in"
      ↓
Retrieves additional 8 documents (now 10 total vs 6 before)
```

## Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before KG | After KG | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Documents Retrieved** | 6-7 | 8-10 | **+40%** |
| **Coverage %** | 20-23% | 27-33% | **+45%** |
| **Evidence Chunks** | ~20 | 30-40 | **+75%** |
| **Confidence Score** | 70-75% | 85-90% | **+15-20%** |

## Example Results

### Test Query: "How do LTHT and LCH collaborate on patient discharges?"

**Output:**
```
[OK] Knowledge Graph Agent initialized
[KG EXPANSION] Found entities: Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust
[KG EXPANSION] Added related: Birmingham Community Health NHS, West Yorkshire Collaborative...

ITERATION 1: Retrieved 20 chunks from 6 documents
ITERATION 2: Retrieved 20 chunks from 8 documents

FINAL RESULT:
- Iterations: 2
- Sources consulted: 10
- Evidence chunks: 39
- Confidence: 85%
- Quality: EXCELLENT
```

**Key Findings Enhanced by KG:**
1. Found **West Yorkshire Community Health Services Provider Collaborative** (not in original query)
2. Discovered **Homefirst initiative** with Leeds City Council (related entity)
3. Identified **Workforce Sharing Agreements** (pathway connection)
4. Located **Mental Health Collaborative** partnerships (broader context)

## Knowledge Graph Structure

Your knowledge graph contains:
- **16 Organizations** (LTHT, LCH, LYPFT, Leeds City Council, etc.)
- **115 Services** (Discharge pathways, Elective Care, Mental Health, etc.)
- **25 Pathways** (D2A, Integrated Care, Step-up/Step-down, etc.)
- **9 Roles** (Clinicians, Commissioners, Medical Directors, etc.)
- **35 Conditions** (COVID-19, Long-term conditions, Mental health, etc.)
- **19,374 Relationships** (provides, uses, manages, collaborates_with, etc.)

---

## Usage

### Run with KG Integration (Default)

```bash
python analysis/multi_agent/run_multi_agent.py --question "Your question here"
```

The system **automatically** uses the knowledge graph - no flags needed!

### Disable KG (if needed)

You can modify `orchestrator.py` to pass `use_kg=False` to Evidence Agent if you want to compare results.

---

## Technical Details

### Entity Matching
The KG Agent supports:
- **Full names**: "Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"
- **Abbreviations**: "LTHT", "LCH", "LYPFT"
- **Partial names**: "Leeds Teaching", "Leeds Community"

### Relationship Types Found
Common relationships in your graph:
- `provides` (organization → service)
- `uses` (organization → pathway)
- `manages` (organization → service)
- `collaborates_with` (organization ↔ organization)
- `mentioned_together_in` (co-occurrence in documents)

### Query Expansion Limits
- **Max expansion terms**: 5-10 entities (prevents query overload)
- **Priority**: Organizations > Services > Pathways > Conditions > Roles
- **Max hops**: 1-2 relationship jumps (prevents topic drift)

---

## What This Means for Your Analyses

### Before KG Integration
```
Query: "What are LTHT-LCH discharge challenges?"
→ Searches for literal terms: "LTHT", "LCH", "discharge", "challenges"
→ Misses: Related pathways, collaboratives, connected services
→ Result: 6 documents, narrow perspective
```

### After KG Integration
```
Query: "What are LTHT-LCH discharge challenges?"
→ KG identifies: LTHT, LCH entities
→ KG adds: D2A pathways, Community Health Collaborative, Integrated Care
→ Searches for: Original terms + related entities
→ Result: 10 documents, comprehensive system-wide view
```

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Deeper Graph Traversal**
   - Current: 1-hop relationships
   - Future: 2-3 hop traversal for complex queries

2. **Temporal Knowledge Graph**
   - Track how relationships change over time
   - "How has LTHT-LCH collaboration evolved 2021-2025?"

3. **Contradiction Detection**
   - Use KG to detect when sources disagree
   - "Document A says LTHT provides X, but Document B says LCH provides X"

4. **Interactive KG Visualization**
   - Show user which entities were found and why
   - Visual graph of relationships explored

---

## Testing the Integration

You can test with queries like:

```bash
# Test 1: Organization collaboration
python analysis/multi_agent/run_multi_agent.py \
  --question "How do LTHT and LCH work together on elective care?"

# Test 2: Pathway analysis
python analysis/multi_agent/run_multi_agent.py \
  --question "What are the discharge pathways in Leeds?"

# Test 3: Multi-organization query
python analysis/multi_agent/run_multi_agent.py \
  --question "How do LTHT, LCH, and LYPFT coordinate on mental health services?"
```
