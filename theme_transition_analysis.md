**Generated:** 2025-10-20 20:56:15

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares the LCH Workforce Strategy 2021-25 (7 themes) with the proposed 2026-31 strategy (5 themes).

**Key Findings:**
- 2 themes consolidated (Resourcing → Talent; Wellbeing → Staff Experience)
- 1-2 themes potentially missing (Leadership, System Partner prominence)
- New emphases on NHS systems, Neighbourhood Health, and 10-year plan
- Some valuable objectives may not be retained

## 1. Theme Transition Mapping

### Resourcing (2021-25)
**Maps to:** Talent (2026-31), Organisation Design (2026-31)
**Explanation:** Recruitment and staffing elements move to Talent; workforce planning moves to Organisation Design

### Organisation Design (2021-25)
**Maps to:** Organisation Design (2026-31)
**Explanation:** Mostly retained but with added emphasis on Neighbourhood Health and system partnership

### Leadership (2021-25)
**Maps to:** POTENTIALLY MISSING, Talent (embedded)
**Explanation:** No standalone Leadership theme in 2026-31; some leadership dev embedded in Talent

### Inclusion (2021-25)
**Maps to:** Inclusion (2026-31)
**Explanation:** Retained with focus on data-driven and embedded approaches

### Wellbeing (2021-25)
**Maps to:** Staff Experience (2026-31)
**Explanation:** Wellbeing becomes part of broader 'Staff Experience' theme

### System Partner (2021-25)
**Maps to:** Organisation Design (embedded), POTENTIALLY MISSING
**Explanation:** System partnership elements moved to Organisation Design; may lack the strategic emphasis

### Foundations (2021-25)
**Maps to:** People Services (2026-31)
**Explanation:** HR services and foundations renamed to 'People Services' with NHS systems emphasis

## 2. Objectives from 2021-25 Not Explicitly in 2026-31

The following strategic areas from the previous strategy don't appear explicitly in the new theme objectives:

1. **Require all new leaders to attend Leadership Essentials** - May still be addressed but not explicit in theme objectives
2. **Senior leader 360 assessments** - May still be addressed but not explicit in theme objectives
3. **Mentoring scheme for new leaders** - May still be addressed but not explicit in theme objectives
4. **Talent management and succession planning** - May still be addressed but not explicit in theme objectives
5. **Allyship and Reverse Mentoring programmes** - May still be addressed but not explicit in theme objectives
6. **Reverse Mentoring programme** - May still be addressed but not explicit in theme objectives
7. **ARRS offer to primary care** - May still be addressed but not explicit in theme objectives
8. **GP Confederation support** - May still be addressed but not explicit in theme objectives
9. **Hybrid Working approach** - May still be addressed but not explicit in theme objectives
10. **Career pathway specification and diversity** - May still be addressed but not explicit in theme objectives

**Recommendation:** Review whether these dropped areas remain important and, if so, how they're addressed.

## 3. New Strategic Emphases in 2026-31

The new strategy introduces or emphasizes several areas not prominent in 2021-25:

- **Neighbourhood Health model**: Specific focus on neighborhood health implementation
- **NHS 10-Year Plan alignment**: Explicit commitment to deliver 10YP objectives
- **ATS/Recruitment technology**: Emphasis on Applicant Tracking Systems for efficiency
- **Organisation of Adults**: Social care framework application (potentially new context)
- **Employee relations capacity**: Specific focus on ER casework complexity and volume
- **Data and insights-driven**: Stronger emphasis on data-driven decision making
- **NHS models and systems adoption**: Adoption of national NHS systems and approaches

## 4. Potentially Missing or Under-emphasized Themes

### 4.1 Leadership Theme
**Status:** Not a standalone theme in 2026-31

**Old Leadership Theme Objectives:**
- Deliver leadership development provision adapted to organisational needs
- Require all new leaders to attend Leadership Essentials course
- Identify areas with leadership capability issues and create action plans
- Commission 360 degree assessments for senior leaders
- Focus talent management on underrepresented groups
- Explore opportunities with system partners for leadership programmes
- Implement new mentoring scheme for new and struggling leaders

**Assessment:**
- Leadership development is mentioned in Talent theme but not with same strategic emphasis
- No explicit mention of: 360 assessments, mentoring schemes, talent management focus
- Succession planning not visible in new objectives
- Leadership diversity and inclusion elements moved to Inclusion theme

**Recommendation:** Consider whether Leadership warrants reinstatement as standalone theme, especially given:
  - NHS People Plan emphasis on leadership for culture change
  - Succession planning importance for 5-year period
  - Service transformation will require strong leadership capability

### 4.2 System Partner Theme Prominence
**Status:** Elements in Organisation Design but not strategic priority

**Old System Partner Theme Objectives:**
- Develop and share #TeamLeeds talent pipeline with city partners
- Lead on protocols enabling working across organisational boundaries
- Deliver Leeds One Workforce objectives
- Work in partnership with Anchor Institutions
- Enable GP Confederation to become mature employer
- Develop LCH ARRS offer into self-sustaining model
- Support LCH staff to develop collaborative working skills

**Assessment:**
- System partnership has moved from standalone theme to part of Organisation Design
- Some specific objectives missing: #TeamLeeds talent pipeline, GP Confederation maturity, ARRS development
- May be underemphasized given ICS/ICP integration importance

**Recommendation:** Strengthen Organisation Design theme with explicit system partnership objectives, or consider reinstating as standalone theme.

## 5. Detailed Theme Comparison

### Coverage Analysis

| Area | 2021-25 Themes (7) | 2026-31 Themes (5) | Status |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Recruitment/Resourcing | Resourcing | Talent | Consolidated |
| Career Pathways | Resourcing/Leadership | Talent | Consolidated |
| Leadership Development | Leadership | Talent (embedded) | Downgraded |
| Succession Planning | Leadership | NOT VISIBLE | **GAP** |
| Inclusion/Diversity | Inclusion | Inclusion | Retained |
| Health & Wellbeing | Wellbeing | Staff Experience | Consolidated |
| System Integration | System Partner | Organisation Design | Consolidated/Downgraded |
| HR Services | Foundations | People Services | Renamed/Enhanced |
| Hybrid Working | Organisation Design | NOT VISIBLE | **GAP** |
| Workforce Planning | Organisation Design | Organisation Design | Retained |

## 6. Strategic Recommendations

### Priority 1: Leadership Theme Reinstatement
- Reinstate Leadership as standalone theme for 2026-31 strategy
- Include: succession planning, 360 assessments, mentoring, leadership diversity
- Rationale: Essential for service transformation and culture change

### Priority 2: System Partner Elevation
- Strengthen system partnership strategy given ICS/ICP priorities
- OR: Elevate to standalone theme if system integration is strategic priority
- Include: #TeamLeeds pipeline, inter-organisational working, primary care partnership

### Priority 3: Retain Explicit Objectives
- Hybrid working approach (retained in objectives or explicit in Organisation Design)
- Career pathway diversity and development
- ARRS and primary care partnership models

### Priority 4: Ensure 10YP Alignment
- Excellent that new roles/apprenticeships are explicit in Talent theme
- Expand to ensure all themes connect to specific 10YP objectives
- Create mapping of strategy objectives to 10YP priorities

### Priority 5: Add Emerging Themes to Consider
- **Digital Transformation**: New skills, systems adoption, technology enablement
- **Retention and Career Progression**: Critical in tight labour market
- **Equity and Health Disparities**: Local health inequalities context
- **New Role Development**: Emerging roles from 10YP and Neighbourhood Health

## 7. Conclusion

The move from 7 to 5 themes consolidates related areas and reflects NHS priorities around systems and the 10-year plan.

However, consolidation risks losing strategic focus on:
- **Leadership capability and succession** - critical for transformation
- **System partnership prominence** - important for integrated care
- **Explicit workforce planning** - needs continued emphasis

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this analysis with strategy sponsors
2. Conduct stakeholder consultation on missing themes
3. Map strategy objectives to NHS 10YP deliverables
4. Consider adding embedded objectives back into theme descriptions
5. Identify metrics aligned with both LCH and NHS priorities
