## Strategic Findings

**Traceability Legend**:
- **[FACT]** = Direct quote/data from source document
- **[SYNTHESIZED]** = Multiple facts combined into coherent insight
- **[INFERENCE]** = Strategic interpretation/implication

### Finding 1: Integrated Care Partnerships Enhance Service Delivery

[SYNTHESIZED] The integration of Leeds Integrated Care Partnership (ICP) and the Leeds Primary Healthcare Collaborative aims to deliver seamless and efficient primary and community health services. This collaboration is expected to improve patient care by reducing fragmentation and enhancing coordination between different healthcare providers [Source4, Source5, Source6].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "The advent of a Leeds Integrated Care Partnership (ICP) and the introduction of the new LCH Third Sector Strategy both bring further opportunities for collaboration on shared priorities for the benefit of our Workforce Strategy ambitions, overall business objectives, and, most importantly, our communities."
  → Workforce-Strategy-2021-25-V1.0.md
- [FACT] "Leeds Primary Healthcare Collaborative, which is Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust and the Leeds GP Confederation whose aim is to jointly deliver city-wide seamless and efficient primary care and community health services for patients."
  → Leeds Community Annual-report-2024-2025.md

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] Establishing and strengthening Integrated Care Partnerships (ICPs) can be strategically leveraged to improve workforce efficiency and patient outcomes by fostering collaboration across healthcare providers.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Evidence of ICPs and collaborative efforts in Leeds.
- ASSUMPTION: Collaboration leads to improved service delivery.
- LOGIC: By reducing silos and improving inter-provider communication, patient care can become more efficient and effective.

Caution: The success of ICPs depends on the effective implementation of collaborative practices and the willingness of all parties to engage fully.

### Finding 2: Demand and Capacity Imbalance Risks Patient Care Quality

[SYNTHESIZED] There is a significant risk to patient care quality in neighbourhood teams due to an imbalance between capacity and demand, which is exacerbating waiting times in specific services such as ICAN PND [Source7].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "Risk of reduced quality of patient care in neighbourhood teams due to an imbalance of capacity and demand."
  → LCH-Trust-Board-Meeting-Public-Papers-4-09-2025-AMENDED _1_.md
- [FACT] "Waiting times in ICAN PND services are above acceptable levels."
  → LCH-Trust-Board-Meeting-Public-Papers-4-09-2025-AMENDED _1_.md

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] Addressing the capacity-demand imbalance is crucial for maintaining care quality. Strategic workforce planning should prioritize resource allocation to high-demand areas to prevent service degradation.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Documented risks of reduced care quality due to imbalances.
- ASSUMPTION: Increasing capacity or redistributing resources can mitigate these risks.
- LOGIC: Aligning workforce capacity with demand ensures that patient care standards are upheld.

Caution: Assumes that resource reallocation or capacity increases are feasible and will directly address the imbalance.

### Finding 3: Timely Access to General Practice is a Priority

[SYNTHESIZED] Improving timely access to general practice is a key priority for NHS England, with expectations set for ICBs to support GP practices in enhancing patient access and experience [Source1, Source12].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "Improve patient experience of access to general practice as measured by the general practice."
  → priorities-and-operational-planning-guidance-january-2025.md
- [FACT] "ICBs are expected to continue to support general practice to enable patients to access appointments in a more timely way and improve patient experience."
  → priorities-and-operational-planning-guidance-january-2025.md

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] Workforce planning should focus on optimizing staff allocation and workflows in general practice to meet the strategic priority of improving patient access and experience.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Explicit priority on improving access to general practice.
- ASSUMPTION: Workforce adjustments can improve access.
- LOGIC: By ensuring adequate staffing and efficient workflows, patient access can be enhanced, aligning with strategic priorities.

Caution: Assumes that access issues are primarily workforce-related and not due to other systemic factors.

---

### Finding 4: Engagement with Patients and Communities is Essential

[SYNTHESIZED] Engaging patients, carers, and communities in shaping health services is critical for ensuring that healthcare delivery is responsive to local needs and improves patient outcomes [Source15, Source16, Source17].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "Involving patients, carers, and communities is critical for ensuring that plans deliver better outcomes and services that are responsive to local needs."
  → NHS England _ Planning framework for the NHS in England.md
- [FACT] "Engaging patients and the wider public in shaping health services."
  → Leeds Community Annual-report-2024-2025.md

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] Workforce planning should incorporate mechanisms for ongoing patient and community engagement to align healthcare services with local needs and preferences.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Importance of patient and community engagement.
- ASSUMPTION: Engagement leads to more effective service delivery.
- LOGIC: By actively involving stakeholders, healthcare services can be better tailored to meet the specific needs of the community.

Caution: Assumes that engagement will be effective and that input can be integrated into service planning and delivery.

## Epistemic Analysis

Understanding what we **know** vs what we **assume** vs what we **infer**:

### Definitions
- **FACT**: Direct statement from authoritative source (verified data, published statistics, official statements)
- **ASSUMPTION**: Reasonable extrapolation based on trends or patterns (e.g., "turnover will remain at 15%")
- **INFERENCE**: Logical conclusion drawn from combining facts and/or assumptions (e.g., "therefore we need 750 recruits")

| Type | Count | Ratio |
|------|-------|-------|
| **FACT** | 5 | 25.0% |
