**Foreword**** **

As ever, we look back on the past 12 months with pride and recognition for our colleagues who, even through difficult times, have provided timely and effective care to the people of Leeds. We extend our thanks to them for the support they provide day and night, all year round, and for their outstanding ability to deliver highly complex care in, or as close as possible, to a person’s own home. 

We have continued to provide the highest levels of care, with an unrelenting focus and intention to support people living with the highest levels of deprivation. Our Health Equity section provides many clear examples of this. We have done this alongside colleagues in the health, social care and voluntary sectors all of whom share our ambition for all people across our community to be given the best start in life, to remain healthy and to age well. 

Whether frontline or in support roles, we know our colleagues need access to the best possible resources to provide modern healthcare. Improvements in this area have been a key focus of the year and you will find examples in this report of how we have digitised processes to improve patient care. This commitment was further backed, in year, with the introduction of an Associate Director of Digital Transformation to our strategic team. We recognise the importance of digital solutions within a community model of care and our intention is to grow and expand in this field, whilst ensuring our services remain accessible to all. 

Our teams have done much this year to move further through the recovery phase of COVID-19, and we have continued to do all we can to respond to staff health and wellbeing needs. We enjoyed a record response to our Staff Survey, with improvements in almost all areas. Whilst you can read more about our successes within this report, the results also confirmed that our focus on health and wellbeing must remain strong into 2024/25. We must remain vigilant to the needs of colleagues who still report feeling burned out and overwhelmed. We know that great healthcare begins with team members who feel well enough to provide it to others. 

Working collaboratively remains a high priority, and successful work to strengthen partnership working continued. One strong and evidence backed example, is our work with Yorkshire Ambulance Service, to clinically triage patients and provide alternative community support before an ambulance is dispatched. Working together, we have diverted many patients away from the hospital door over the past year and this is a prime example of one of our core principles – to keep a person well and at home. This targeted in-reach is further exemplified in our continued funding of the Enhance project, which sees our Neighbourhood Teams working with multiple and diverse third sector organisations to provide non clinical wraparound care to people on neighbourhood caseloads across the city. 

Relationships with Leeds ‘Place’ and with the West Yorkshire Integrated Care Board remained strong. However, we recognise that across all health and social care partnerships across the City and indeed regionally and nationally, the scale of the financial challenge is high, with Trusts being stretched to their financial limits. Our Financial report will give you some indication of the scale of stewardship required this year and this position intensifies into 2024/25. As such, in January we launched our Quality and Value Programme, a three-year programme which seeks to review all our systems, processes and care pathways to identify where and how our organisation can offer even better value for money.

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**





During 2023/24 we experienced some further industrial action, and we are pleased to report that this impacted minimally on our services and that robust plans were in place to mitigate against disruption of services and to ensure safe levels of care. 

The Trust also navigated a significant time of change for its executive team, and you can read more about this in the Directors’ Report. Thea Stein, who had been Chief Executive of the Trust for nine years, stepped down in August to assume the role as Chief Executive at the Nuffield Trust, a national independent health think tank. Bryan Machin, who provided financial oversight to the Trust as its Director of Finance since the Trust’s inception in 2011, also left to begin his retirement. We extend our sincere thanks to them both for their service and dedication to the Trust, not least through a very challenging and remarkable period in NHS history. From April 2024, Selina Douglas joins the Trust as its new Chief Executive. We know that her experience of working in strategic roles across diverse health and social care sectors will be of huge benefit to us as we move forward. 

In closing, we would like to reaffirm our pride in this organisation. It is our privilege to work alongside our colleagues and partners in the city and we very much look forward to even more progress over the coming year. 

Thank you, 

****

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Our purpose is to provide high quality community healthcare. We do this by working together with other organisations and groups, involving, and developing our colleagues, and using our resources wisely to continually improve services. We work in partnership with the NHS, social care, the criminal justice system and the third sector. 

The Trust was rated Good overall in its most recent inspection by the Care Quality Commission \(CQC\), and we were pleased to have been rated Outstanding for our Sexual Health Services. 

We promote equity of service delivery to different groups throughout the organisation. 

We continue to raise awareness of equality and support our staff networks \(Race Equality, Disability, Neurodiversity and Long-term Conditions, and LGBTQIA\+\) in their efforts to create an inclusive environment for patients and staff. We believe that a workforce that reflects its community will be able to serve that community better.

**Patient stories **

Patient stories and case studies are shared with our Board by patients or by the services that support them. These stories highlight our vision, values and behaviours in action. 

Here is Sue’s story:

**Taking control of diabetes**

Our Structured Education Programme \(LEEDS\), developed by two of our Diabetes Specialists helped Sue take control of her diabetes. 

The LEEDS Programme \(Learning, Empowering, Enabling, Diabetes Self-Management\) is a quality assured programme for people living with 

Type 2 Diabetes. It is delivered by Diabetes Facilitators either in face-to-face sessions at a choice of citywide venues or through an online course \(delivered via MS Teams Live Events\). 

Sue had been living with Type 2 diabetes since 2014. Medication doses, including insulin, increased over the years to try to control her blood glucose levels. Sue was regularly referred to the Community Diabetes Team and in October 2022 was re-referred due to worsening symptoms. In March 2023, Sue was fitted with a Continuous Glucose Monitoring Sensor but was also introduced to the LEEDS Programme, so that she could feel empowered to better self-management of her condition. 

Sue attended three sessions of the LEEDS Programme and 

said of her experience:

“I have seen a real improvement in my general health and 

wellbeing. I feel more educated and confident now in 

controlling my condition with medication. I know so much 

more about how a healthy lifestyle and the effect diet and 

drinking alcohol has. The programme has really helped me 

set goals that were important for me.”

**Leeds Community Healthcare’s strategic goals**** **

The Trust Board agreed four strategic goals for 2023/24:

**• **To deliver outstanding care. 

**• **To ensure our workforce community can deliver the best possible care in all the communities that we work with. 

**• **To work in partnership to deliver integrated care closer to home and reduce health inequalities. 

**• **To use our resources wisely and efficiently. 

These strategic goals guided our approach to how we provided care, managed our resources, and worked with our health and social care partners to meet the needs of patients, at the same time as looking after the health and wellbeing of our colleagues. 

**Key risks**

In Spring 2023, a review and benchmarking exercise streamlined the number of strategic risks connected to our goals \(from 21 to 10\) for 2023/24. Each strategic risk has a Lead Director\(s\) and Lead Committee\(s\). The level of assurance given for the management, and reduction of severity, of these risks is reported to the Trust Board at each of its meetings:

**• Risk 1:** Failure to deliver quality of care and improvements. 

**• Risk 2: **Failure to manage demand for services. 

**• Risk 3: **Failure to invest in digital solutions. 

**• Risk 4: **Failure to be compliant with legislation and regulatory requirements. 

**• Risk 5: **Failure to deliver financial and performance targets. 

**• Risk 6:** Failure to have sufficient resource for transformation programmes. 

**• Risk 7: **Failure to maintain business continuity \(including response to cyber security\). 

**• Risk 8:** Failure to have suitable and sufficient staff resource \(including leadership\). 

**• Risk 9:** Failure to involve and engage staff. 

**• Risk 10:** Failure to collaborate. 

The Performance Overview in this report describes how the Trust managed its strategic risks to achieve our goals during 2023/24. These arrangements receive oversight and scrutiny through the Board Assurance Framework. 

Risk management, including the Board Assurance, is considered in more detail in our Annual Governance Statement, which can be found on page 80 of this report.

**Performance Report **

**Performance Overview**

In their Foreword, the Trust Chair and Interim Chief Executive commented on how the Trust continued, during 2023/24, to move through the recovery phase of COVID-19. We recognised the impact on our staff personally and professionally and have focussed on strengthening our support offer. 

Our work on prevention, and championing self-care, also continued as ‘Sue’s Story,’ earlier in this report highlights. Working in partnership across the city we have found more ways to empower patients to take control of their own health and lead on some, or all, aspects of their care. This year saw an ever-increasing focus on those living with the greatest inequity. 

As such, we continue to develop a suite of Equity data sets for the Trust on Access \(referrals/appointment outcomes and waiting lists\) and Outcomes \(incidents/outcome measures and mortality\) analysed by deprivation and ethnicity. The Leeds Place based Integrated Care Board Delivery Subcommittee \(of which Leeds Community Healthcare is a member\) monitors progress against Core20PLUS5 \(an approach to reducing healthcare inequalities\) at a city/system level. Our approach to health equity includes Core20PLUS5 

considerations and contributes to its achievement. 

The Board seeks to make sure that the Trust is delivering the priorities it agreed for the year and that operational, or day-to-day, performance meets the expectations of our patients, commissioners, partners, and regulators. It does this through a wide range of formal and informal processes, formal public Board meetings, a committee structure and through engagement with patients, colleagues and stakeholders. 

The Trust’s operational performance against a range of national and local targets and standards is assessed and reported on, internally and externally. The targets and standards are derived from the NHS Oversight Framework, our contracts, and local priorities. 

They are grouped into five domains which align to the Care Quality Commission’s \(CQC\) governance framework – we then add a finance domain. Monitoring of the individual measures within these domains gives us an overall view of the Trust and our current performance. The Board considers a Performance Brief at each meeting which describes our current performance. This is available as part of the Board papers which are published on the Trust’s website:

**www.leedscommunityhealthcare.nhs.uk** 

In the following sections we outline how we delivered against our priorities for the year and our performance against key performance indicators \(KPIs\). 

**How we met our Strategic Goals**

Our Trust vision is that ‘we provide the best possible care in every community we serve’. To continue our work to achieve this vision, we set ourselves four strategic goals, alongside Trust priorities for 2023/24. Although our priorities are matched to a particular goal, they work well with our other goals too. 

**12**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



Here are our four goals and the priorities we had to support them: **Goal 1 – Deliver outstanding care**

***Priority: Be responsive to the needs of our populations as we deliver safe and ***

***effective care on our journey to outstanding care. ***

In line with our values of continuing to listen, learn and improve we have engaged with our teams \(and wider stakeholders\) and developed an action plan so we can better identify, share, and embed learning from patient safety incidents across the organisation. 

This was finalised and launched in January 2024. Our Patient Safety Incident Response Plan \(PSIRP\) has identified our local safety priorities in addition to national priorities as a blueprint for the Trust’s approach to learning and improving in the forthcoming year. 

Within our **Adult Services** we have taken learning from national ‘gold standard’ models and begun a pilot for a newly developed ‘Response Team’ to improve coordination and allocation of ‘unplanned’ work and reduce disruption to planned visits. Early feedback is positive. Citywide rollout and impact data collection will take place during 2024/25. 

In addition, our Neighbourhood Team, supported by the Integrated Care Board, worked with Yorkshire Ambulance Service \(YAS\) and Local Care Direct, to better connect YAS 

to primary and community services. This pilot directed people to services that offer a better experience of unplanned ‘same day care’ by providing the right care first time and reducing ambulance transportation to the Emergency Department \(ED\). From July to December 2023, 247 cases were either closed remotely or referred for a ‘Quick Response’ 

from the Neighbourhood Team. These patients would otherwise have had an ambulance sent and a trip to the Emergency Department, potentially experiencing long waiting times. 

We are pleased that the pilot was extended until the end of March 2024 because of its positive results. 

The involvement of our service user and carers is essential to our goal of delivering outstanding care. 

Across our **Children and Families service **our Youth 

Board has been involved with a range of projects and 

services this year. For example, supporting a Patient 

Led Assessment of the Care Environment \(PLACE\) at 

our community respite facility for children with special 

needs and debilitating illnesses \(Hannah House - see 

picture opposite\). This is the first-time young people 

have been involved; the two youth board members 

were supported to join a Healthwatch representative, 

and a Friend of LCH, to bring a young person’s 

perspective to the assessment. 

We have also revamped our Involvement Group \(was Parent and Carer Forum\) to make sure anybody can be involved, not just parents and carers. It is now open to anyone over the age of 19. We also launched our Involvement Newsletter to celebrate and promote our work with children, young people and adults. 

**13**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



**Goal 2 - Use our resources wisely and efficiently**

***Priority: To deliver our Cost Improvement Plan target and contribute to Leeds ***

***Health and Care Partnership’s Cost Improvement Plan, while ensuring we maintain ***

***a focus on quality and safety. ***

Alongside achieving our cost improvement plan, we continue to look at ways to innovate and transform the way our services are delivered. 

Some examples of how we have achieved this include:

**• **Our key role in the **Home First **

**programme** - more information can be 

found on page 16. A methodology to 

capture and track the financial benefits of the programme has recently been agreed and although there is no direct financial saving for LCH, growth in community capacity and a change in processes has significantly reduced the length of time people spend in hospital and social care beds. Ultimately, this will lead to significant financial benefits across the Leeds health and social care system. 

**• **As described in the foreword, improving our digital technology has been, and will continue to be, a key area of focus through the year. 

**• **A large and complex project to introduce a new electronic patient record \(SystmOne\) into Children and Young People’s Mental Health Services has been completed during the year. As a result, we have been able to introduce an Electronic Prescribing System which allows for a more efficient and effective approach to the prescribing of medicines for our patients. 

**• **Following the successful joining together of our electronic patient record \(SystmOne\) and e-Community software, more recently we have been able to begin testing new allocation software in our Neighbourhood Teams. Once in place this will enable a more efficient and streamlined process for scheduling visits. 

**• **Working with the Integrated Care Board, our Night service team has undertaken a service review and has been able to deliver targeted improvements delivering cost savings through a significant reduction in service provision by the independent sector but also ensuring there is a consistent level of quality in provision and continuity of care between the Neighbourhood Teams and Nights Service. 

**• **Following an options appraisal and Equality Impact Assessment process undertaken alongside the Integrated Care Board \(ICB\), the Long COVID Community Rehabilitation Service has been redesigned improving financial sustainability by ensuring the service can be delivered within the financial envelope set aside by commissioners. Further opportunities for redesign of the service, alongside other system partners, will start to be explored in 2024/25. 

**• **As we aim to ensure all our services are clinically and financially sustainable, we have begun reviews of a number of our specialist services in readiness for a commissioner tender process in 2024/25. 

**14**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**Goal 3 - Enable our workforce to thrive and deliver the best possible care** 

***Trust Priority: Support our workforce to recover and flourish, with enhanced ***

***focus on resourcing and health and wellbeing. ***

We recognise our teams as the key asset in all that we do. Great patient care can only be provided by colleagues who feel supported both in small ways and on a larger scale to deliver on our vision to ‘deliver the best possible care to every community we serve.’ 

From practical changes, such as the introduction of a Trust-wide uniform store with minimum stock levels, in order to reduce colleague waits for receiving new uniform, to an intensive focus on career development, such as our successful Nursing career pathways work, to uplift Trainee Community Matrons \(TCMs\) to Community Matrons through a new competency framework and paperwork review \(12 TCMs were appointed as Community Matrons as a result\). We remain committed to improving the working environment and career opportunities of our colleagues. 

This has been further evidenced at service level within our Children and Families service, Black and Minority Ethnic \(BME\) colleagues have accessed a mentoring programme and apprenticeship support, for roles such as speech and language therapy, social work and nursing. The wider organisation is now learning from this work to further improve access to apprenticeships and development posts. 

Encouraging the right people to come and work with us has always been important to the Trust, as demonstrated by our ongoing Hyper local recruitment success. But so too is retaining the right skills and experience within our existing workforce. We believe Trustwide initiatives put in place this year have contributed to a sustained improvement \(reduction\) in staff turnover. At 31 March 2024, our staff turnover was at a very healthy 9%, which is well within the Trust’s maximum acceptable threshold of 14.5%. 

These initiatives include: 

**• Talent Development programme for BME colleagues:** To increase diverse and inclusive representation across all leadership tiers and to make sure our future staffing model better reflects the communities we serve. 

**• Neurodiversity and Wellbeing awareness sessions: **400 colleagues attended five virtual sessions to understand more about Neurodiversity, both from a workplace perspective and in terms of working with neuro diverse patients. 

**• BME Diverse recruitment panels:** Over 20 colleagues volunteered to be part of a pool of people involved in the full recruitment and selection process for all posts at Band 7 or above. The process was put in place early February 2023. 

**• Hyper local recruitment:** An award-winning area of focus \(which seeks to recruit through targeted communications to postcodes near to our clinics and sites\). We are up to almost 200 recruits in the 18 months the initiative has been running. 

**• International Community Nurses: **We are currently welcoming a third group of international colleagues to the Trust. 

**15**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**





**Goal 4 - To work in partnership to deliver integrated care, care closer to** **home and reduce health inequalities **

***Trust Priority: Work pro-actively across the system with all the communities we ***

***serve to improve health outcomes, improve patient flow and continue to drive ***

***integration. ***

The HomeFirst programme 

continues to see progress 

citywide in its aims of 

improving access to 

intermediate care and the outcomes for Leeds residents using these services. 

As part of this programme, we have introduced a ‘Home Ward’ supporting patients with Frailty and Respiratory conditions. Both wards are there to provide support and care to people who become suddenly unwell but can be safely cared for in their own home. They can also support people to return home from hospital sooner. The Home Wards have consistently performed above national expectations over 2023/24, benchmarking positively against other areas regionally and nationally with regards to use. 

Our respiratory ward is equivalent to 12 beds and consistently achieves 80% ‘bed’ use, working efficiently to get patients on and off the ward in a timely way. Plans are in place to develop the referral criteria, to make best use of all available capacity and increase average use levels more. The first area being looked at is ‘Bronchiectasis’, although this relates to a small number of patients, developments here could have a real impact on reducing length of hospital stay. 

Our frailty ward received its highest number of referrals in October 2023; a total of 387. The service changed the way it worked to include national requirements and ‘other’ system offers. 

**16**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



Our **Enhance** partnership with Leeds Older 

People’s Forum has been funded since 

2022/23 and went live in June – July 22. It 

sees us investing in Leeds’ third sector 

partners’ skills and networks to keep people 

well and socially connected and in turn, 

reducing the pressure on Leeds Community 

Healthcare, the hospitals and wider health and social care system. In 2024/25 Enhance partners will support patients referred by a wider range of LCH services, with a focus on the people and services where the most time savings can be made for LCH clinicians. 

During the year we will also be formally evaluating the success of the partnership with a view to developing a cost-effective proposal for the future. 

A key success in Children and Families service this year was the introduction of a community led Community IntraVenous Antibiotics Service \(CIVAS\) for children. Launched in February 2024, it followed 12 months of hard work from a dedicated Leeds Community Healthcare team in partnership with colleagues at Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. 

In our specialist services we continue to collaborate with partners on a number of high-level projects, as demonstrated through the retention of the contract with commissioner Leeds City council for the Leeds Sexual Health service. We will continue to be the lead provider working alongside Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds GP Confederation and Forum Central \(the collective voice for the health and social care third sector in Leeds\) to provide the innovative new model - focussed on reducing inequalities in sexual and reproductive health across communities, by removing barriers to access. Innovations include a new Digital Health Hub, to manage capacity and demand and to direct people quickly and easily to the right service and a new, interactive website that can ‘talk to’ the patient management system \(SystmOne\) to support online booking, live web chats and online prescription ordering. Also, a new telephone contact centre to make sure there is an entry point for those without digital access. 

In further collaborative work we also provided project management support to the Community Dental Service \(CDS\) Time to Shine Project, for the West Yorkshire Community Dental Service Collaborative. 

**Key outcomes so far are:**

**• **Creation of one service specification for the whole of West Yorkshire. 

**• **Task and Finish Group set up to achieve one General Anaesthetic pathway for West Yorkshire. 

**• **Out of Area Patients process review. 

**• **Work to reduce data collection differences across the Collaboration to reduce service offer differences. 

Pilots are ongoing between Community Dental Services in West Yorkshire, with learning shared. The pilots are also looking at ways to upscale moving forward. 

**17**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

On a trustwide level we continue to work on the following: **Health Equity Strategy 2021 - 24:** The next phase in looking at and addressing inequity in our care and pathways will begin in May 2024. A Board workshop in October 2023 agreed a specific Health Equity strategic goal, which will be further developed to identify success measures, and to inform upcoming health equity activity. 

**The Public Sector Equality Duty:** requires us to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations between different people when carrying out their activities. Our Equity and Quality Impact Assessment goes beyond the removal or minimisation of disadvantages suffered by people due to their protected characteristics to include focus on deprivation and health inclusion groups. This year, 22 initial EQIAs have been brought to panel with risks identified and mitigated. 17 have had a further review to confirm that the proposed action and mitigation has successfully reduced identified risks. 

**Accessible information Standard:** All providers of NHS care must meet this standard; to identify, record, flag, share and meet people’s information and communication needs. We have gone beyond the legal requirements to apply this to people with a disability, impairment or sensory loss. We have also included other vulnerable / marginalised groups. For example, people with low levels of literacy and other community languages. Working with communities and partners, we have increased recording of communication needs and developed a new template to share these needs across our services. This template has been shared as an example of good practice with partners. Further work to support sharing of communication needs across partners, and compliance with the Accessible Information Standards, is being overseen by the Person-Centred Care Expert Advisory Group, in which LCH is represented. 

**Engagement Principles:** The way we work with patients, carers, families and communities is important for the success of all our Goals, and so this year we also developed our Engagement Principles. 

Our Engagement Principles set out how we work with people, particularly from community groups experiencing inequalities, to make sure we are listening to all voices and so that we can act on what we hear. These Principles will be at the centre of everything we do and will also support us in being a good partner in the City’s ambition to deliver joined up care that is well communicated and compassionate. 

**Person centred**

**We** will put patients and carers at the centre and focus on the strengths that each individual and community brings. 

**We** will be open and honest about what is possible and will be led by people rather than strategy and plans. 

**Accessible**

**We** will work to ensure all our engagement activity is easily accessible to everyone. 

**We** are committed to breaking down barriers to engagement including meeting any communication needs as required by the Accessible Information Standard. 

**18**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**Inclusive**

**Performance Analysis**

**This section gives a more detailed analysis of how we performed in key areas during** **2023/24. **

**Our Performance Monitoring Processes**

The Trust Board monitored a wide range of Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) across six domains:

**• Safe -** people are protected from abuse and avoidable harm. 

**• Caring -** staff involve and treat people with compassion, kindness, dignity, and respect. 

**• Effective -** people’s care, treatment and support achieves good outcomes, promotes a good quality of life, and is based on the best available evidence. 

**19**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**• Responsive -** services are tailored to meet the needs of individual people and are delivered in a way to ensure flexibility, choice, and continuity of care. 

**• Well-led -** leadership, management and governance of the organisation assures the delivery of high-quality person-centred care, supports learning and innovation, and promotes an open and fair culture. 

**• Finance -** our resources are managed well and put to the best uses. 

The Board was supported in its monitoring of operational performance by the Quality Committee, Business Committee, and the Senior Operations Performance Panel. Each of our three Clinical Business Units provided monthly written reports on their performance, including risks, key initiatives in support of our staff, and plans for improvement to the Senior Operations Performance Panel. These reports covered all six domains. 

A summary of these details was reported to committees every two months, and then presented to Board for final review. 

Next year we are committed to including measures from our System Viability Work, to reflect the context that we now work within. We are also developing equity measures for the responsive domain indicators, to make sure we are managing waiting lists equitably. 

All the Performance Reports considered by the Trust Board are available as part of the Board papers on our website **www.leedscommunityhealthcare.nhs.uk **

**Our Performance against Key Performance Indicators**

The Trust’s services worked exceptionally hard to achieve our performance targets in 2023/24 and we are proud of our ongoing commitment to provide high quality services. 

We achieved many of our targets despite another difficult year of complex demand and reduced staffing. 

Difficulties still exist however, for patients able to access services in a timely way. The total number of patients on our waiting lists increased again this year, as did the average amount of time they needed to wait. Despite this, most of our patients waited less than 18 weeks to start treatment. We continue to look at ways to improve this, within the resources we have available. Throughout next year, we want all our patients to have a positive experience of our services. 

**Safe**

We are proud that our services continued their excellent track record of safety. Our Serious Incident Rate remained well below the target of 0.1 per 1,000 contacts for the whole of the year. With the improvement work led by the Trust Falls Improvement Group we saw a reduction in the number of falls with harm compared to the previous year. This approach is being reflected in the forthcoming year and is aligned with our Patient Safety Incident Response Framework \(PSIRF\). 

We are in the process of putting in place NHS England’s new Patient Safety Incident Response Framework \(PSIRF\). The framework sets out the NHS’ approach to developing and maintaining effective systems and processes for responding to patient safety incidents **20**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

for the purpose of learning and improving patient safety. Reporting on the new process is in development. 

Rates for community acquired infections remained at significantly low levels, and we remained well below our internal targets for the numbers of avoidable pressure ulcers. 

The number of patient safety incidents remained at levels consistent with previous years. 

We have maintained a positive level of reporting, which we believe is a critical feature of our open and transparent culture around patient safety. This is highlighted by our reporting of incidents without harm. In 2023/24, 88.03% of our reported patient safety incidents involved no harm occurring to patients. 

**Caring**

**Friends and Family Test \(FFT\)**

We ask people who use our services how we did via the Friends and Family Test \(FFT\). We do this through an online link, a QR \(Quick Response\) Code, paper postcards and text message. 

The FFT is available in a standard easy-read format and is translated into the most spoken five languages in Leeds. We also have child friendly surveys, developed alongside children and young people. We want to make giving feedback easier for people whose first language is not English, and for those people with communication or accessibility needs. 

Between 1 April 2023 and 1 April 2024, 

**7386**

**2760**

of people \(7386\) used the online survey, 

an increasingly popular option. We also 

received responses in writing from 27% 

of people \(2760\). Making sure people can get in touch in different ways is important to us. 

Survey results showed that 95% of people \(9628\) felt our services were good or very good, 2% of people \(244\) said poor or very poor and 3% of people \(272\) felt their service was neither good nor poor. 

**Concerns, Complaints and Compliments**

We welcome all forms of feedback as an opportunity to improve. It can be difficult to speak up when things go wrong but, for our teams to learn from and develop services, or to share good practice and celebrate when things go well, we must be ready to listen. 

In 2023/24 we received 1419 compliments, concerns,

**Effective**

**Annual Audit Report – Effectiveness**

The effectiveness of our services is measured primarily through our compliance with NICE 

\(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\) guidelines, and by our Annual Audit Programme \(AAP\). Our teams recorded strong progress once again in these areas as:

**• **For 2021/22 there is 1 open NICE Guidance. 

**• **For 2022/23 there are 4 open NICE Guidance. 

**• **For 2023/24 there are 29 open NICE Guidance. 

Three Trust wide audits and 135 local audits were registered as part of the AAP for 2023/24:

**• **At the end of the 2023/24 the AAP is in a much-improved position compared to the end of the 22/23 AAP. This is due to a significant drive in 2023/24 for a more robust process for the AAP which has now been implemented by the Clinical Effectiveness Team. 

The Team is actively contacting services to ensure that all pending registration forms are submitted. The Team also contacts Clinical and Operational Heads of Service for quarterly updates. 

**• **The audit registration and summary report form has been updated to include equity analysis and the Clinical Effectiveness Team are working on how they can report on and demonstrate assurance via the Trust’s Quality Assurance and Improvement Group \(QAIG\) that services are delivering safe and effective care and reporting any associated risks.

**• **To bring equity analysis into audit looking at standards we meet and do not meet, and disproportionate outcomes. 

**Responsive**

The number of people waiting for care has grown steadily through the year. We have been unable to meet all our targets to see people in a timely way. 

The areas under pressure:

**• **Children’s Neurodevelopmental Services

**• **Community Gynaecology

**• **Continence, Urology and Colorectal Service \(CUCS\)

**• **Children’s Occupational Therapy

They have all experienced significant increases in referrals and demand for services has outstripped capacity. 

Work to improve waiting times for children requiring neurodevelopmental services, including autism assessments, continues both in Leeds and nationally. Locally, we have been able to increase paediatrician capacity. We have also been working closely with partners across Leeds to address increased demand and to look at different ways we can provide the service. 

**23**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Waiting times in Community Gynaecology have been high throughout the year. This service is delivered in partnership with Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust \(LTHT\), Meanwood Practice Specialist Menopause Clinic and GPs. There have been delays in the triage of patients waiting for the community service and therefore delay in delivering care to them. We are working closely with our partners to improve this situation. 

The time patients wait for care in the Continence, Urology and Colorectal \(CUCS\) Service has increased through this year. This has been due to an increase in the complexity of patients and reduced availability of specialist staff. The service has put actions in place to address this, including dedicated triage and clinicians working across multiple specialisms. 

There is a national shortage of Children’s Occupational Therapists and, due to a high number of vacant posts, the number of children waiting for care increased. The vacant posts are now filled, and work is ongoing to see children currently waiting for care in a timely manner. 

The Children’s Audiology Service is our single diagnostic service, aiming to provide access to diagnostic checks within six weeks. Our performance against this standard has improved steadily throughout the year but remains significantly below the standard of 99%. We will continue to focus on improving our performance and have put in place service changes and productivity improvements to respond to a continuing backlog that first developed due to COVID-19. 

Our Neighbourhood Teams and Home Ward \(Frailty\) services deliver an urgent community response to people in need of support who may otherwise be admitted to hospital. We aim to reach those patients within two hours of referrals. We have improved our response times in relation to this over the year and are now consistently exceeding the national target of 70%. 

**Well-led**

Turnover during the year has remained consistently below the 14.5% target, ranging between 12.5% and 9% which is really pleasing to see and healthy. Turnover rates within the nursing and midwifery staff group were higher than we would wish but the Trust has responded to this through a range of retention initiatives including development of our staff through apprenticeships and other interventions, engagement with staff and utilising feedback from exit interview as well as initiating ‘stay’ conversations. Additionally, we have continued our excellent work on recruitment including international recruitment, recruiting from within our local communities and the development of several clinical apprenticeship roles. 

Overall sickness absence during 2023/24, month by month, has tracked below the absence levels in the previous year. Short-term sickness absence levels remained within tolerance throughout the year. Our focus remains on supporting the prevention of and return from long-term sickness absence, where stress/anxiety/depression remains the most prevalent sickness absence reason. This picture is replicated in other NHS organisations and indeed the wider UK workforce, but nonetheless considerable efforts continue to be made to keep all our staff well and at work. 

Most of our staff are in work most of the time. We want them to be the best they can be and to provide care as safely and effectively as they can. An annual appraisal can support **24**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

that. Whilst our annual appraisal rates are steadily improving from last year, we continue to hover around the mid 70% which remain below our target of 90%. New appraisal paperwork has been introduced to make the appraisal experience more people focussed and a new appraisal season has been piloted and shown some success. Compliance with statutory and mandatory training continues to be high just falling short of the 90% target, mainly due to much of the training available online and can be completed by staff at a time that suits them. 

It is pleasing to note that our continued focus on the Workforce Race Equality Standards \(WRES\) resulted in some improvements in increasing the diversity of our workforce. 

12.3% of our overall workforce now identifies as Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic \(BAME\) background, and 7.9% of staff are in Senior roles. We know we have much more work to do in this area. We strongly believe that this focus is necessary and that the benefits will be seen not just in improvements on race equality standards but in other areas where we need to see improvement such as the Workforce Disability Equality Standards. 

Finally, as set out elsewhere in this report, our Staff Survey results have continued to improve year on year demonstrating good engagement with our workforce across Leeds Community Trust.

\*The Trust transitioned to the Patient Safety Incident Response Framework \(PSIRF\) in January 2024. This is a big change in the framework that has changed how we report on incidents. We therefore did not monitor incidents via these indicators through the latter part of the year as more qualitative monitoring processes were in place. This means that our year end numbers are not comparable to previous years. 

**26**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



**Sustainability **

Over 2023 we have continued to see a gradual increase in the Trust’s carbon emissions profile. However, this is in keeping with the sustainability department’s predictions for emissions. which have changed dramatically over the past three years. During 2020-2021 

emissions significantly decreased due to the response to the pandemic, then drastically increased following the surge of activity as business returned to normal with the additional patient backlog. During 2023 this upwards trend has continued but at a steadier rate comparative to the previous volatile years. 

Over 2023/24 the recording of the Trust’s carbon data has improved in accuracy, most notably in procurement. This improved data collection has decreased the overall carbon emissions of the Trust from 8782 tCO2e in 2022/23 to 4701 tco2e. 

It is important not to celebrate this reduction as, although our emissions have decreased with improved recording, the Trust’s carbon trend within both travel and estates continues to rise. If emissions continue to rise in these areas Net Zero will likely become unattainable without radical change. Narrative will always be provided with data submission to stipulate if emission changes are due to improved recording or following a project. This will allow the sustainability department to provide a transparent and accurate review of the Trust’s progression. 

Despite this gradual increase in travel and estates a variety of interventions have been carried out over the past year in keeping with the Trust’s sustainability project list. This includes the continual promotion of the changes to the salary sacrifice and business lease schemes, along with reducing the carbon cap of the vehicles these schemes offer. Bike shelters have been installed across the Trust’s retained estate, in a step towards promotion of active travel and away from single car occupancy. The Estates department have also opportunistically upgraded lighting to LED, for example in the reception at Burmantofts Health Centre. 

Moving into 2024 work will be aligned with the Trust’s Quality and Value programme to aid in the delivery of projects that offer both increased value and carbon saving measures. 

Projects will likely span across all the carbon dense areas of the Trust, procurement, estates, waste and travel. The sustainability department will continue along the trajectory outlined in the Trusts’ 2022-2025 Green Plan moving into 2024/2025. This does include providing advice into wider climate change adaptation requirements. 



**27**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



The Trust has undertaken risk assessments on the effects of climate change and severe weather and has developed a Green Plan following the guidance of the Greener NHS 

programme. The Trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are complied with. 

Progress against the Green Plan is monitored twice-yearly by the Trust’s Business Committee and Board. The Sustainability and Environmental Manager also attends the Estates Strategy Implementation Board, which in turn reports through to Business Committee. 

The Executive Director of Operations is accountable for the delivery of the Green Plan with specific responsibilities shared across the Executive Team. The portfolio will move to Finance and Resources in the course of 2024/25.

**Our Staff**

**NHS Staff Survey**

The annual NHS Staff Survey invites 

everyone working in the NHS to give their 

views on working life. It is completely 

independent, and we encourage colleagues 

to use this important feedback tool. 

We are proud to say we achieved another 

record response rate of 61.7%. We have 

consistently improved response rates over 

the last 4 years. Comparing response rates 

over the last four years we are \+3.4% 

\(2022\) \+9.7% \(2021\) and \+16.7% \(2020\). 

We have achieved this through dedicated 

resource to engage with people on the 

staff survey, collaborating between teams 

and services, putting in place an effective 

communication and engagement plan, and 

receiving senior level sponsorship from 

the Chief Executive, directors, and general 

managers. We will look at response rates 

with teams and identify key actions to 

boost response rates for 2024. 

Our 2023 key findings, compared to 2022 

include:

**• **Highest response rate to date 61.7% \(up 

3.4% on 2022\). 

**• **Increased Engagement and Morale 

scores for the overall Trust and across all 

business units. 

**• **Significant improvements and increased 

scores against 6 of the 7 People Promise 

themes. 

**• **Overall, 85% of questions recorded an improved score. 

**• **Our scores are in the average range \(and on some occasions\) higher than the Community Trust comparator group. A real improvement on last year where typically we scored just below the average score. 

**• **We are above the national average scores for all 7 People Promise themes and Engagement and Morale scores.

**Awards and recognition**

**External awards **

During the year we were delighted that so many individuals, teams 

and services received national and regional recognition. 

The Trust was awarded the NHS Pastoral Care Quality Award to 

recognise our work in international recruitment and our commitment to providing high-quality pastoral care to internationally educated nurses and midwives during recruitment processes and their employment. 

Christine Comer, Head of Musculoskeletal Service, was recognised as Highly Commended at the Yorkshire and Humber Clinical Research Network Research Awards in the Research Allied Health Professional of the Year category. 

Steph Lawrence MBE, Executive Director of Nursing and Allied Health Professionals was highly commended in the inaugural William Rathbone X Annual Award. 

The Finance Team were named Finance Team of the Year at the regional Healthcare Financial Management Association Awards. 

Dr Jill Halstead-Rastrick, Podiatrist, Clinical Head of Service for Podiatry & Clinical Lead for Research was presented with an academic award in the House of Lords by the Royal College of Podiatry. 

Hayley Ingleson \(Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust and Leeds Primary Care Practice Learning Facilitator - Nursing\) was shortlisted for Educator of the Year at the Nursing Times Awards 2023. 

Best Recruitment and Workforce Planning Strategy winner at the 2023 HR Excellence Awards. 

Noor Ul Haq, Registered Nurse and Pastoral Support Lead, awarded the International Community Nurse of the Year at the Queen’s Nursing Institute Ceremony. 

The Integrated Children’s Additional Needs Service \(ICAN\) shortlisted as a finalist for the Health Innovation Award at the National SEND Awards for their Innovation Project. It involved making reasonable adjustments in bloods clinics for children and young people with additional needs, to create an individually tailored experience. 

Details of our awards during the year can be found on our website: **https://www.leedscommunityhealthcare.nhs.uk/our-news/awards/**

**Internal awards**

We continued to celebrate achievement through our monthly internal ‘Thanks a Bunch awards.’ Staff nominated their colleagues for being shining examples of our Trust behaviours. In 2023/24 directors presented 12 awards personally thanking nominated staff for their continued hard work and commitment. 

Our 2023/24 annual staff awards built upon the monthly recognition scheme theme and were an in-person event, replacing the online approach taken in the previous two years due to COVID-19. The award winning ‘Thank You’ event saw directors surprising colleagues at staff meetings to congratulate teams and individuals for their outstanding efforts** **

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



**Building capacity **

A commitment to maximising capacity continues to be at the forefront of our work. The aim being to continue to deliver the best possible care to the people of Leeds and beyond. 

Our hyper-local recruitment success and the introduction of our second cohort of international nurses is highlighted in this report. We have also been delighted to win this year a national HR Excellence Award for our hyper-local recruitment success. 

Other initiatives that have helped us to build, or maintain, staffing capacity include:

**• **Enhanced reward measures targeted at priority services and shifts. 

**• **Continued promotion of ‘InstantPay’ to allow in-month access to wages for shifts worked. 

**• **Collaborative work with health and social care partners to address shared resourcing challenges. 

**• **Continued development of our apprenticeship programmes. 

A positive employee relations climate is held in place by our values and behaviours and our People Before Process approach. Also, a regular schedule of formal and informal partnership meetings with Trade Union colleagues and staff network representatives. 

Our work in the ‘Leeds system’ continues, including the delivery this year of a flexible working ‘We Can Flex’ programme for Leeds, a central role in the Leeds One Workforce Strategic Board and providing workforce expertise for the GP Confederation. 

**Inclusion**

To meet our ambition to be more representative of our communities and to further tackle and reduce outstanding disparity in colleague experience, the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Forum, chaired by the Trust’s Chair, has continued to bring employee perspectives, experiences, and ideas together. One area identified for improvement was to increase the number of staff who identify as Black Minority Ethnic \(BME\). We recently launched a bespoke Talent Development Programme for colleagues who identify as BME, to widen our talent pool and diversify our workforce. 

We have continued to encourage discussions about inequality and cultural awareness through our Cultural Conversations work, and completion of the 5th cohort of Allyship and Reverse mentoring programmes. 

Our Race Equality Network has supported an increased visibility of colleagues from Black and Minority Ethnic \(BME\) backgrounds on recruitment panels and improved cultural awareness by linking into national campaigns, religious holidays and sharing personal stories through our internal communications channels. 

We believe all LGBTQIA\+ people should be accepted without exception and promote this through the NHS Rainbow badge. We were involved 

with Phase II of the Rainbow Badge initiative and hold bronze level accreditation. Work will continue to develop the newly formed 

LGBTQIA\+ staff network group.

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



Supporting colleague wellbeing continues to be a focus of attention. Highlights from last year include:

**• **A new Disability, Neurodiversity and Long-Term Conditions Staff Network, with over 50 

members. 

**• **Accreditation as a Mindful Employer. 

**• **Neurodiversity awareness sessions attended by over 400 colleagues – this demonstrates a need for awareness and support around this topic. 

**• **Launch of an enhanced Employee Assistance Programme, to provide colleagues with a range of wellbeing support and resources, including access to counselling. 

Whilst we continue to make progress across many of the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion areas, we know there is still much to do. 

**Staff health and wellbeing**

We provide and commission a full range of employee wellbeing services to support colleagues’ physical and mental wellbeing at work; and to provide additional help and guidance in the event of ill health. 

The support colleagues have accessed during 2023/24 includes:

**• **Over 1100 appointments with occupational health clinicians. 

**• **Over 400 support calls with the Trust’s Employee Assistance Programme. 

**• **Over 75 phased return to work programmes, to make sure that people returning to work after a lengthy period of absence have the right support to do so successfully. 

This support has contributed to LCH successfully increasing employee attendance during 2023/24, largely due to a steady reduction and stabilisation of long-term sickness absence. A position further reflected in the NHS Staff Survey, with 68% of colleagues saying we take positive action for staff health and wellbeing: up 2% from 2022. Also, 78% of colleagues said their immediate manager is interested in listening to them when describing the challenges they face. 

We continue to offer a wide range of support covering physical, mental, and financial wellbeing, including structured and preventative work on psychological health and wellbeing for colleagues. 

This includes:

**• A new critical incident debriefing model:** Critical 

Incident Staff Support Pathway \(CriSPP\), which has 

supported over 50 requests for either group or 

individuals to be debriefed. 

**• Schwartz Rounds:** Over 16 support sessions, to come together and reflect on the various emotional and social challenges associated with working in healthcare. 

**• Staff Development Day for Health and Wellbeing Champions \(over 60 people\) and** **Mental Health First Aiders \(over 70 people\):** To work on our health and wellbeing objectives and to hear feedback on how to better support their development.

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



During 2023, we also became a ‘Mindful Employer’. See the 

Inclusion section of this report for details of our commitment 

to neurodiversity awareness and our new Disability, 

Neurodiversity and Long-Term Conditions staff network group. 

As living costs have continued to rise, there has also been an even closer focus on financial wellbeing, to make sure that we are providing colleagues with access to a range of support when they need it. This includes the facility to ‘stream’ some of their earned wages sooner than pay date, access a range of webinar based financial sessions, co-ordinated with our Anchor organisations, as well as the recent decision to continue to pay the Real Living Wage for a further year. 

Work continues to raise awareness to managers and staff on the wide range of health and wellbeing support available. 

**Financial Performance**

At the start of the year, we formulated our income, expenditure and workforce plans, ensuring that we continued to use our resources wisely and efficiently.to not only maintain day-to-day services, but to continue to, innovate and improve service provision and pathways, both within our own services and across Leeds, all within block contract income arrangements. 

Despite a challenging financial environment, managing the costs of hyper-inflation and the impact of industrial action the Trust ended the year with a surplus of £309k, details of our performance are included within the table below. 

The financial performance recognised by NHS England excludes a number of technical items such as impairments of land and buildings and capital grants and donations, taking this into consideration the Trust ended the year with an adjusted surplus of £267k.

As an NHS Trust we are required to abide by our own statutory duties to carry out our functions effectively, efficiently and economically, however we are also a partner of the West Yorkshire Integrated Care System. The importance of this for financial performance is the role we play in ensuring the West Yorkshire System is also able to manage within the resources allocated. 

**33**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Due to competing demand for investment the Integrated Care Board \(ICB\) in Leeds was unable to provide for the full cost of rising demand and growth in our services, but Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust was able to manage these costs by utilising its own resources. These resources were available in 2023/24 only, mainly due to interest rates generating a higher-than-expected level of income on cash balances and the pace of recruitment into vacant posts. By using our own resources in this way we were able to contribute positively to the financial performance of the West Yorkshire health and social care system which also has a statutory duty to break-even. 

Despite a challenging labour market, the Trust has been highly successful in recruiting to vacancies alongside this we have reduced our reliance on agency staff, allowing the Trust to perform better than planned against its agency control total. 

**Cash and Capital Expenditure**

The Trust continues to manage cash well with a closing cash and cash equivalents balance of £43.5m, an increase of £2.3m. Alongside this we have continued to meet the majority of our commitment to the Better Payment Practice Code, which requires payment of all trade creditor invoices within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice \(unless other terms have been specifically agreed with the supplier\). The target set is 95% for both value and number of invoices. The results for the year are shown in the table on page 35. Three out of the four targets were above 95%, with the exception being the NHS by number, which was slightly below target at 94.7%

We invested £15.9m in capital assets which matched our revised capital resource limit. The table below summarises how we made this investment:

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

move a number of services into a modern purpose built, energy efficient environment with better transport links, which will help with the delivery of services for the Trusts health population in the short and medium term. 

The Trust also made a £2.5m investment into digital infrastructure and new technology, the latter being possible due to the Trust’s successful bid for national monies of £1.75m for frontline digitisation. The funding has supported delivery of the Trusts strategic priorities, being used primarily to support improvements in computer hardware, enabling staff to make full use of digital tools available to support delivery of care, the introduction of digital letters and the implementation of a patient prioritisation tool based on health equity to enable active waiting list management. 

**Efficiency**

In delivering our financial position the Trust planned and delivered £8.2m of efficiency savings of which £3.7m was recurrent and £4.5m non recurrent. 

Recurrent savings were achieved mainly as a result of the management of inflationary cost uplifts on goods and services along with income growth generating a contribution to infrastructure costs. 

Non recurrent savings were achieved largely due fortuitous gains on interest receivable and vacancies. Overall delivery of savings during 2023/24 represented a reduction of c3.6% 

of the total trust income. 

In summary at the end of 2023/24 financial performance remains strong performing well against all the targets sets, this is the 13th straight year that Leeds Community Healthcare has met its targets and the challenge to achieve that does not get any easier.

**Forward look**

As we move into the new financial year, the scale of financial challenge for the NHS and Leeds Community Healthcare, is significant. 

To ensure the Trust can live within the funding allocated we will have to manage the full impact of inflationary costs alongside reductions in growth funding and local costs pressures. This represents an unprecedented efficiency target of £15.8m, with costs having to reduce by just over 7%. 

Despite the enormity of the task, we have responded positively to challenge and in January 2024 the Trust launched its Quality and Value Programme. The programme represents a three-year drive to transform the way in which we deliver our services and as I reflect on the engagement and commitment I have seen to date from all colleagues, I am optimistic that the Trust will rise to the challenge delivering safe, high-quality services that are affordable.

**Legal obligations and how we are **

**meeting them **

**Improving Health Equity**

In May 2021 we formally committed, through approval of our first Health Equity strategy, to address unfair and avoidable differences in the health of different groups and communities, by working with communities and partners to create equitable care and pathways. 

The development and delivery of the strategy is the first stage in our long-term commitment to address what is a long-term problem of 

inequities in health across our population and delivery. Nationally and across regional and local systems, focus on addressing health 

inequalities continues. Our strategy supports us to move from intent to action, identifying and addressing inequities within our own 

provision of care as well as contributing to cross-system action to address wider determinants. 

**We deliver our strategy through nine areas of work. **Highlights of this year include identifying and addressing inequity through:

**• Person-centred care** – increasing recording of communication needs; based on learning from this, revising the template for recording communication needs; development of easy read and Plain English patient information; delivery of Health Literacy awareness sessions. 

**36**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**• Quality and Safety** – embedding the use of equity data in quality reports to identify whether the risk of harm from healthcare is experienced unequally across different groups of patients, the mechanisms that drive these differences in risk and possible solutions; introducing feedback from patients and carers ‘did bias or equitable care issues play a part in this’ as part of the Duty of Candour process. 

**• Availability and use of data** – improvements in inclusion of equity data achieved through clear expectations that Committee and Board reports must all consider data through an equity lens and improved availability of equity data through the development of a suite of self-service equity reports and equity data embedded within newly developed dashboards. 

**• Workforce and leadership** – delivery of phase 1 of rollout of our Cultural Conversations programme, with eight services/departments across all three Business Units and corporate teams, including training for service leads on cultural competence and facilitating conversations with teams about working with different cultures and identities. 

**This works well with delivery of our statutory duties: **

**• Accessible Information Standards** require us to identify, record, flag, share and meet the communication needs of people with disabilities and sensory impairments. Working with system colleagues to respond to patient and carer feedback, and reporting to the Leeds Health and Wellbeing Board, we have broadened the focus of our communication recording to include community languages as well as reasonable adjustments. 

Communication needs are recorded, flagged and shared through a template in our electronic patient record. Procurement of digital communication tools considers how we increase accessibility of information by systematising how we continue to meet people’s communication needs. 

**• Equality Delivery System \(EDS22\)** is the revised national framework for assessing equality in the NHS, with domain 1 focussed on commissioned services. For maximum effect, we worked as a Leeds-wide system to assess and develop improvement plans for equity in delivery by with the ICB and NHS Trusts across 2 pathways - maternity and children and young people’s mental health services. Data and feedback from patients, carers and the third sector, identified strengths, particularly in use of data to understand the totality of patient access journey \(referrals, waiting lists, cancelled and missed appointments\) demonstrating that we are rating ‘achieving’ in terms of fairness across communities. This has also identified actions for improvement around understanding how the mental health needs of all protected characteristic and health inclusion groups can be better met, for example through trauma-informed approaches; the collection of demographic information and subsequent analysis in relation to ensuring services users are free from harm and service user experience. 

**• Armed Forces Covenant** includes a legal obligation to have due regard to the principles of the covenant for the Armed Forces community, which includes currently serving members of the UK Armed Forces \(regular and reserve\), veterans, and family members. This means consciously considering the Covenant when developing, delivering, and reviewing policies and decisions which may impact the Armed Forces community. In practice this includes consideration of access, experience, and outcomes of the Armed Forces community in EQIAs and acting to address disadvantages the Armed Forces community might face compared to the general population, such as mitigating the risk of longer waiting times due to a mobile lifestyle or proactive engagement for example, Leeds Mental Wellbeing Service.

**Emergency Preparedness and Resilience**

All NHS Trusts are required to adhere to the requirements of the NHS England Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response \(EPRR\) Framework and to take part in the annual assurance audit against the EPRR Core Standards. The purpose of this process is to assess the preparedness of the NHS - both commissioners and providers - against a set of common NHS EPRR Core Standards to provide assurance that NHS Trusts in England, NHS England, and the Integrated Care Boards are resilient and prepared to respond to emergencies whilst maintaining the ability to continuing to deliver safe patient care. 

In 2022/23 the NHS EPRR Annual Assurance process changed from a self-assessment against the NHS England Core Standards to a revised process where NHS organisations were required to provide and submit supporting evidence via a secure portal directly to NHS England. The scoring mechanism and evidence requirement for the exercise changed considerably from the year before and subsequently we were assessed as being non-compliant. This was also the case for all the other Trusts in the North East region. 

To address the feedback from the NHSE 2022/23 Annual Assurance audit the Trust has worked closely with Internal Audit to develop a focused EPRR Improvement Plan which has been approved by our Business Committee. 

Whilst work is underway, through the implementation of the EPRR Improvement Plan, to improve our level of compliance we continue to fulfil our requirements as set out in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. The NHS Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response Framework requires the Trust to ensure we can respond in a robust and co-ordinated way to any form of disruption to normal service delivery or a major incident. This includes the development and regular review of:

**• A Major Incident Plan** which is regularly tested and updated to ensure it is fit for purpose in line with the Trust’s Command and Control and On-call arrangements. 

**• Business Continuity plan**s to protect against the impact of a wide range of emergency situations which may affect normal service deliver. 

**• Emergency planning functions** to manage national issues that may impact the ability of the Trust to continue to deliver safe services. 

**• Training **– the majority of Trust On-call Managers have now attended the NHS England Principles of Health Command Training programme at either a Strategic \(Gold\) or Tactical \(Silver\) level and in addition a number of our On-call Directors have also undertaken the Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Principles \(JESIP\) training provided through the West Yorkshire Resilience Forum. 

**38**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**Health and Safety **

We are committed to maintaining an environment where the health and safety of staff, patients, visitors, contractors, and the public is assured. This is in line with the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999. 

We recognise that putting in place effective health and safety arrangements depends on managers, staff and their representatives working together at all levels. 

The Health and Safety Group is the forum that enables staff to be involved in developing and reviewing the Trust’s health and safety arrangements. The group which met five times in 2023/24 is chaired by the Executive Director of Workforce Finance and Resources and its membership includes staff-side representatives. 

The Health and Safety Group reviews and proposes changes and developments of the health and safety management system to make sure there is continuous improvement against health and safety performance. 

**Counter Fraud**

We do not tolerate fraud and we work hard to prevent, deter, detect and investigate it. 

Our counter fraud work is undertaken by a counter fraud specialist from our Internal Audit Team and is overseen by the Executive Director of Finance and Resources. Our counter fraud work complies with the NHS Standards for Providers of NHS services. 

**Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement**

In accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015, Leeds Community Healthcare can confirm that it meets its responsibilities under this act. As an NHS organisation, suppliers are subject to standard NHS terms and conditions. 

**Disclosure of Personal Data Related Incidents **

The UK GDPR and the related Data Protection Act 2018 \(collectively ‘Data Protection Legislation’\), and the Common Law Duty of Confidentiality are the primary legal frameworks under which the Trust processes Personal Data. 

These pieces of legislation outline our obligations and responsibilities regarding the Personal Data we hold and use, and the rights that individuals may have over that Personal Data. 

Included within these obligations is the requirement that incidents evaluated as being externally reportable due to non-compliance with legislation must be reported to the Information Commissioner’s Office \(ICO\), and in line with NHS requirements this is done through NHS Digital’s Data Security and Protection Toolkit \(DSPT\). 

For details of the personal data related incidents reported by the Trust during 2023/24 

please see the Annual Governance Statement on page 80.

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



**Safeguarding**

Safeguarding is about working closely 

with families and partner agencies in 

health and social care to respect the rights 

of everyone to live life free from abuse, 

neglect or emotional harm. 

The Trust is committed to safeguarding 

our population through effective 

multiagency working and public 

engagement in line with our 

organisation’s vision and values while 

recognising Leeds City Council’s Social 

Work service as the lead agency. 

The Trust approved a three-year strategy in August 2023. The strategy sets out our direction of travel and priorities for Safeguarding 2023-2026 and outlines the vision of making safeguarding everybody’s business, and recognising safeguarding is fundamental to our duty as care providers. 

**Duty of Candour **

The Quality Committee monitors the Trust’s compliance with Duty of Candour requirements on a regular basis. This ensures that applicable incidents have met the criteria of a safety notifiable incident which are:

**• **A rapid review was carried out to understand the initial facts in relation to what happened, what went wrong and what we could have done better. 

**• **The people affected were informed and necessary apologies given. 

**• **The people affected were provided with an explanation of how we would investigate and asked if they required any specific questions to be answered within the investigation. 

**40**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



**Going Concern Assessment**** **

Going Concern is an accounting principle that requires organisations to consider whether they can continue their operations for the foreseeable future when preparing their Accounts. 

These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial reporting framework applicable to NHS bodies, derived from the HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual, defines that the anticipated continued provision of the entity’s services in the public sector is normally sufficient evidence of going concern. The directors have a reasonable expectation that this will continue to be the case. 

The Board considered the matter of the Trust as a going concern at its meeting on 28 

March 2024. Our formal financial reporting begins on page 79.

**Corporate Gover****nance Report**

**The Trust Board - What we do and how we do it **

Along with all NHS trusts across the country, we have a Board of Directors to guide our work. The purpose of our Board is to govern effectively, and to build patient, public and stakeholder confidence that health and healthcare is in safe hands. 

Our Board is accountable to the public and stakeholders for:

**• **High quality, safe health services. 

**• **Accessible and responsive health services. 

**• **Making sure public money is spent in a way that is fair, efficient, effective and economic. 

**• **Being a good employer. 

**• **Engaging patients and the wider public in shaping health services. 

The Board plays a key role in:

**• **Shaping the strategy, vision and purpose of the Trust. 

**• **Holding the organisation to account for the delivery of strategy. 

**• **Ensuring value for money. 

**• **Working to shape a positive culture. 

The Trust’s Chair and Chief Executive/Interim Chief Executive have led these functions throughout 2023/24. 

The Trust Board has both Executive and Non-Executive Directors. It is a unitary Board, which means that both Executive and Non-Executive Directors share the same liabilities and joint responsibility for every decision of the Board. Led by an independent chair and made up of both executive and independent non-executive members, the Board has collective responsibility for the performance of our organisation. 

The Board discharges its day-to-day management of the Trust through the Chief Executive, Executive Directors and non-voting Directors, and senior staff through a scheme of delegation which is approved by the Audit Committee. 

**Board Composition**

Considering the wide experience of the whole Board, the Board believes that its membership is balanced, complete and appropriate and that no individual or group of individuals dominate the Board. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chair of the Trust and Chief Executive which ensures a balance of power and authority. 

The Board has a wide range of skills, and a significant number of members have a medical, nursing or other health professional background. Non-Executive Directors have wide-ranging expertise and experience with backgrounds in finance, digital, healthcare, legal, and third sector.

Her contribution to medical leadership was recognised in Senior Fellowship of the Faculty of Medical Leadership and Management in 2021.

**Andrea Osborne **

\(Interim Executive Director of Finance and Resources from 5 February 2024 to present\)

Andrea joined LCH in February 2024 as Interim Director of Finance and Resources. Based in Tameside she has over twenty years’ experience as a qualified accountant, gained mostly within the hospital sector. In 2016 

she moved to work within mental health and community services, where she found her passion for this area of healthcare. 

With a strong focus on listening to the staff voice to affect change, Andrea is also a keen advocate for health equity, she describes it as a privilege to use her financial experience to support some of the most vulnerable people in our communities, many of whom have long-term or lifelong illnesses. 

**Andrea North **

\(Interim Executive Director of Operations from 1 September 2023 to present\)

Andrea has over 40 years’ experience of working in Leeds, starting her career as a nursing assistant at Meanwood Park Hospital, whilst waiting to begin her nurse training. After qualifying in 1984 with a registration in what would now be referred to as learning disability, Andrea 

developed a passion for person centred care, supporting the closure of the hospital and a move into the community for the people who lived there. 

Andrea then went on to train as a social worker specialising in working with people with a physical disability or acquired brain injury. It was while working for the Local Authority that she started to question the ‘false’ distinctions between health and social care, fighting for people to receive services and funding that truly met their needs. 

After choosing operational leadership as her career path Andrea used her influence to challenge ‘the system’, pushing organisational boundaries, and introducing new ways of working across health and social care. She went on to study Health and Social Care leadership at Huddersfield University, always with the aim of improving services for the people of Leeds. 

As General Manager for the Specialist Business Unit, she was responsible for a broad portfolio of services including those supporting people in the criminal justice system and others marginalised within society. Andrea is passionate about developing services that reach all communities and has led several successful tenders for new business.

**Directors**

**Jenny Allen and Laura Smith **

\(Director of Workforce - job share\)

She is an accredited coach and mentor as well as a qualified HR professional. 

What matters most to both Laura and Jenny in work is people: “the people we work with and the patients and population we work for, both across the City of Leeds and the wider geographic communities served by LCH.”

**50**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

In addition to the changes listed above, Selina Douglas was appointed as substantive Chief Executive from 15 April 2024 and therefore was in post during the approvals process for the Annual Report and Accounts 2023/24. 

**A ‘fit and proper’ Board**

Board members have an annual appraisal, which is a thorough review of the assessment of their performance, reflecting on their contribution to the Trust during the year and setting objectives for the coming year. 

The main components of this are:

**• **The Chair conducts individual performance evaluations of the Non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive, which involves obtaining feedback from a variety of stakeholders; 

**• **The Senior Independent Director conducts a performance evaluation of the Chair, which involves obtaining feedback from a variety of stakeholders; 

**• **The Chief Executive conducts performance evaluations of the Trust Leadership Team. 

The Board has continued with its development programme during the year, including an externally facilitated National Cyber Security Centre assured session on Cyber Security. 

The Trust has a programme of workshops to support Board members’ development, and in 2023/24 covered such topics as organisational strategy, health equity, equality and inclusion, sustainability, and priorities and system planning. Both executives and nonexecutives attend training days and networking events to improve their knowledge base and remain up to date with current NHS matters

All directors have made a declaration that they comply with the revised ‘fit and proper person framework’ that was introduced from September 2023. 

Each director has confirmed in writing that they know of no information that would be relevant to the auditors for the purposes of their audit report, and of which the auditors are not aware, and each has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken to make himself/herself aware of any such information and to establish that the auditors are aware of it. 

All Non-Executive Directors are considered to be independent \(demonstrated through annual appraisals, declarations of interest and independence, and Board and Committee minutes\).

**Board meetings and business in 2023/24**

As with all NHS Trusts, we are required to hold formal Board meetings in public. The Board has met formally seven times during the year. At these meetings, the Board takes strategic decisions and monitors the operational performance of the Trust. Any member of the public is welcome to attend the formal meetings. The Board has further encouraged the public to attend during the year with some Board meetings being held in community venues across Leeds. 

The dates are advertised on the Trust’s website, and Board meeting agendas, reports and minutes are published online. 

The Board has also met informally on a further five occasions during 2023/24. These events have taken the form of a Board development programme and have involved a wider group of senior leaders. 

Attendance at formal Board meetings is outlined below:

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust has a commitment to providing high quality care and reducing health inequalities within our communities. The Trust aims to innovate, build and standardise to deliver high quality, safe and effective care that provides patients, families and carers with the best patient experience. All actions to ensure the Trust meets this commitment are overseen closely by the Board. 

The Board receives regular updates on strategic service developments and regular integrated performance reports \(the report brings together quality and financial information in one document\). Information in the report is aligned to the Care Quality Commission’s \(CQC\) five domains \(safe, caring, effective, responsive and well-led\). This is the main way the Board assesses that it meets all national and local standards and targets for the services we provide. 

**The Board’s committees \(decision making groups\)**

The Trust has five committees that make sure we carry out our duties effectively, efficiently and economically. 

Details of the functions of each committee can be found in our Annual Governance Statement 2023/24 which starts on page 80. 

In addition, the Trust has three ‘Committees in Common’ arrangements involving a number of NHS organisations. A ‘Committees in Common’ approach allows NHS trusts to establish their own committees, which all meet at the same time and with the same remit and common agenda. The two ‘Committees in Common’ are:

**• **West Yorkshire Mental Health Services Learning Disabilities and Autism Collaborative. 

This comprises of the four mental health and community NHS trusts in West Yorkshire \(Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust, Leeds and York Partnerships NHS 

Foundation Trust, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, and South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust\) working together to ensure high quality, sustainable mental health services. 

**• **Leeds Primary Healthcare Collaborative, which is Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust and the Leeds GP Confederation whose aim is to jointly deliver city-wide seamless and efficient primary care and community health services for patients. 

**• **West Yorkshire Community Health Services Provider Collaborative. This comprises of eight community providers in West Yorkshire \(Airedale NHS Foundation Trust, Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust, Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust, Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust, Mid Yorkshire Teaching Hospital Trust, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, Locala and Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS 

Trust\) working together to collectively improve outcomes and make the most of resources. 

These are reflected in the Trust’s current scheme of delegation.

**Compliance with the Code of Governance**

The Board has overall responsibility for the administration of sound corporate governance throughout the organisation. The Code of Governance for NHS Provider Trusts \(the Code\) was published by NHS England. The purpose of the Code is to assist the boards of NHS 

trusts and NHS foundation trusts with ensuring good governance and to bring together best practice from public and private sector corporate governance. 

The Code is issued as best practice, but also contains a number of main principles, supporting principles and code provisions on a ‘comply or explain’ basis. The Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust has applied the principles of the Code of Governance for NHS Provider Trusts on a ‘comply or explain’ basis. The Code of Governance for NHS Provider Trusts, most recently revised in October 2022, is based on the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code and now applies to NHS Trusts in addition to Foundation Trusts. 

A full review of compliance with the Code was submitted to the Trust Board to support this statement. A copy of the full report to the Trust Board is available on request from the Company Secretary. The Trust carried out a detailed self-assessment against the requirements of the Code and submitted the assessment to the Trust Board for approval and to support the statement that the Trust complies with the principles of the Code with the exception as listed in the following table.

The Chief Executive of NHS England has designated that the Chief Executive should be the Accountable Officer of the trust. The relevant responsibilities of Accountable Officers are set out in the NHS Trust Accountable Officer Memorandum. These include ensuring that: 

**• **there are effective management systems in place to safeguard public funds and assets and assist in the implementation of corporate governance; 

**• **value for money is achieved from the resources available to the Trust; 

**• **the expenditure and income of the trust has been applied to the purposes intended by Parliament and conform to the authorities which govern them; 

**• **effective and sound financial management systems are in place and 

**• **annual statutory accounts are prepared in a format directed by the Secretary of State to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs as at the end of the financial year and the income and expenditure, other items of comprehensive income and cash flows for the year. 

As far as I am aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the trust’s auditors are unaware, and I have taken all the steps that I ought to have taken to make myself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the entity’s auditors are aware of that information. 

To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have properly discharged the responsibilities set out in my letter of appointment as an Accountable Officer.

**Statement of Director’s responsibilities in **

**respect of the accounts**

The directors are required under the National Health Service Act 2006 to prepare accounts for each financial year. The Secretary of State, with the approval of HM Treasury, directs that these accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the trust and of the income and expenditure, other items of comprehensive income and cash flows for the year. In preparing those accounts, the directors are required to:

**• **apply on a consistent basis accounting policies laid down by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury; 

**• **make judgements and estimates which are reasonable and prudent; 

**• **state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts and 

**• **prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis and disclose any material uncertainties over going concern. 

The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the trust and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above-mentioned direction of the Secretary of State. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 

The directors confirm to the best of their knowledge and belief they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the accounts. 

The directors confirm that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for patients regulators and stakeholders to assess the NHS trust’s performance, business model and strategy.

**Corporate Governance Report**

**Annual Governance Statement 2022/23**

**Scope of responsibility **

As Accountable Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS Trust’s policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS Trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the **NHS Trust Accountable Officer Memorandum**. 

**The purpose of the system of internal control**

The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust \(LCH\), to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively, and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in LCH for the year ended 31 March 2024 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. 

**Capacity to handle risk**

The Trust recognises that it is operating in a healthcare environment where patient safety, quality of care and service sustainability is paramount and of mutual benefit to stakeholders and the organisation alike. The Trust manages clinical risks \(i.e. risks to individual patients through clinical activity\) and financial and business risks \(i.e. risks that threaten the achievement of statutory financial duties or the safeguarding of the Trust’s assets\) in order to deliver its objectives in a controlled way. With controls and assurances in place, and in line with the Trust’s statement of how much risk it will accept \(‘risk appetite’\), manageable risks are tolerated - but not where there is a foreseeable risk of harm or adverse outcomes to patients. 

Careful risk management is embedded within the culture of the organisation, from risk assessments in clinical practice to considering the risk in each Board decision. Risks are identified and aligned to strategic goals. Risk tolerance, i.e. the level at which risk is escalated, is clearly set out in the Risk Management Policy and Procedure. 

The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for the Trust’s management of risk and members of the Trust Leadership Team have been given responsibility for managing risk types: 

**• **Chief Executive: Risks to staff and stakeholder engagement, integration and system change programmes. 

**80**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**• **Executive Director of Finance and Resources: Risks to efficiency, income and expenditure, IT infrastructure, data security, contractual and partnership governance, health and safety of staff. 

**• **Executive Director of Operations: Risks to major change projects, business tenders, contracted activity, environmental sustainability. 

**• **Executive Director of Nursing and Allied Health Professionals and Executive Medical Director: Risks to clinical quality assessment, clinical quality improvement, clinical governance. 

**• **Director of Workforce: Risks to staff capacity and capability. 

The role of each director is to ensure that appropriate and robust arrangements are in place to:

**• **Identify and assess risks. 

**• **Eliminate or reduce risks to an acceptable level, in line with the Trust’s approach to risk. 

**• **Comply with policies and procedures, and statutory and external requirements. 

**• **Maintain the Board Assurance Framework. 

The Trust employs an experienced Risk Manager who delivers risk management training, coordinates the risk register and provides support and direction in all risk management related matters. 

Mandatory health and safety training was introduced in 2023/24, this incorporates risk assessment training. In addition to the mandatory training, bespoke training is provided to support teams and services with managing risk. A competency relating to risk management has been included in the managers competency framework developed by the organisational development team. There is a page dedicated to risk management on the Trust intranet, this provides access to and signposts to advice and guidance, e-learning and the policy and procedure. All training includes awareness of the Trust’s approach to risk and how this should be applied in decision-making processes. 

**The risk and control framework**

**The Trust’s Risk Management Policy** defines the risk management framework and sets out the approach the Trust will take to the management of risk, making sure that sound risk management principles are an integral part of its governance structure and processes. It also sets out the respective responsibilities for corporate and operational risk management throughout the Trust. 

**The risk management procedure** supports staff to identify, assess, manage, and monitor the risks that threaten the organisation’s ability to achieve its objectives. The aim of the risk management procedure is to achieve an optimum response to risk, prioritised in accordance with a consistent evaluation of the identified risk. 

The Trust has systems in place that contribute to the identification of risk from a number of sources for example: 

**• **Review of performance and working practice. 

**• **Clinical practice. 

**81**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**• **Legislation, national policy and guidance. 

**• **Risk assessments. 

**• **Incident reports. 

**• **Complaints. 

**• **Claims for compensation. 

**• **Audit and workplace surveys. 

**• **Patient satisfaction surveys. 

**• **External/internal audits. 

**• **Regulators’ inspections and reports. 

**• **External environment within which the Trust operates. 

Any of the above can be part of the risk assessment process. Risks are identified in a proactive way, for example: changes or introduction of new processes, new equipment, and different ways of working will initiate a risk assessment. 

The Risk Management Policy and procedure is supported by content in a bespoke risk area of the Trust’s intranet which is available to all staff. 

**The Board Assurance Framework** \(BAF\) enables the Board to be assured that risks to the success of strategic goals and corporate objectives are being managed effectively. The BAF 

aligns strategic risks to the revised strategic goals and priorities in the Trust’s operational plan. 

**The Risk Register** is a record of all the risks that may affect the Trust’s ability to achieve its strategic, project or operational objectives. The Trust uses an electronic risk management system to record and monitor risks. The risk register includes: a description of the risk, the risk owner, any controls currently in place, actions to be completed, and the initial, current and target risk scores. Extracts and themes from the risk register are frequently scrutinised by appropriate managers, committees, and the Board. Risk Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) have been introduced during 2023/24 in order to improve the effectiveness of the risk management process. KPIs highlight the number of risks with overdue review and risks with static scores. KPIs are reported to the Business Units, Trust Leadership Team, and the Board Committees. 

The Trust’s **risk appetite** is aligned with its four strategic goals. The Trust Leadership Team defines the Trust’s risk appetite and reviews this on an annual basis. Any proposed amendments are subject to review by the Audit Committee and approval by the Board. 

The risk appetite statement is an appendix of the Risk Management Policy, which can be found on the Trust’s intranet. The risk appetite was reviewed in 2023, whereby the Trust Leadership Team agreed that the appetite remained appropriate, and no changes were required for 2023. 

In addition to the operation of the risk management strategy, risk management is embedded in the Trust in a number of ways, for example:

**• **There is a lessons learnt portal on the ‘Making Stuff Better’ page on the Trust’s intranet, where managers can share information about incidents, learning and improvements. 

**82**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**• **The risk manager provides guidance, support and training to staff appropriate to their authority and duties. 

**• **Trust employees receive training in equality and diversity, and quality and equality impact assessments are completed for all strategy, policies, and business cases so that the full impact on protected groups is identified and taken into account. 

**• **The Trust has policies in place to encourage employees to highlight risks and report concerns, for example through the whistleblowing policy. 

**Risk assurance process and scrutiny of risks **

Each Business Unit’s performance group includes a review of new risks that have been added to the Trust’s Risk Register. They also review escalated, de-escalated and recently closed risks and acts as a moderator for risk grading, making sure risks are ‘owned’ 

and ensuring that effective management of the risk is being recorded. The groups also maintain an oversight of the practical application of the risk management procedure with support from the Risk Manager. Risks are also reviewed by individual risk owners and by the appropriate directors. 

Assurance creates the bedrock of evidence which gives the Trust confidence that risk is being controlled effectively, or highlights that certain controls are ineffective or there are gaps that need to be addressed. The Trust’s Board Assurance Framework \(BAF\) records strategic risks including risk descriptions, controls and gaps in controls, sources of assurance and gaps in sources in assurance, actions required to remedy gaps in controls or assurance. 

Risks to strategic objectives contained within the Trust’s clinical and service strategies and plans are identified and the BAF has been revised during 2023, in line with the Trust’s operational plan. These strategic risks are assigned to a lead executive to manage. Each of the strategic risks are also assigned to one of the Board’s committees for oversight and scrutiny. Overall scrutiny of the BAF process is provided by Audit Committee. Sources of assurance are reviewed and evaluated by the committees to provide an indication to the Board of the current assurance level for each strategic risk. This information is used to populate the BAF. A summary of this information is presented at each Board meeting. 

The Board receives a significant risks report at each meeting. The report details the Trust’s risks scoring 15 or above \(extreme\), after the application of controls and mitigation measures, as well as information about risks scoring 12 \(high\). It provides an analysis of all risk movement, identifies themes and links these material risks to the strategic risks on the BAF. The Trust Leadership Team reviews the report in advance of the Board. The Quality Committee reviews high scoring clinical and operational risks, and the Business Committee reviews non-clinical risks, rated as high. 

Assurance of risk mitigation is provided to the Board through the Quality, Audit, and Business Committees in relation to clinical and non-clinical risks. The Audit Committee also provides assurance to the Board on the risk management process. 

Together, these mechanisms allow for the appropriate identification, monitoring, control and mitigation of risks, which may have an impact on the Trust’s objectives. 

**83**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**Data security risks** are managed through the Information Governance / Data Protection and Information Technology teams through a series of Trust Policies, technical controls and network of staff who act as information asset owners. These individuals work with the Senior Information Risk Owner to manage data security and other information-related risks. 

Data Security risks continue to be managed through a series of coordinated activities which have included: 

**• **The ongoing release of software patches to ensure our electronic devices remain as resilient as possible to the threat of computer viruses and other cyber security risks. 

**• **The pursuit of Cyber Essentials Plus accreditation, which has led to the introduction of improved threat detection and software patch management. 

**• **Third party penetration tests designed to identify vulnerabilities in the Trust security architecture are conducted regularly. 

**• **The development and testing of service level Business Continuity plans to ensure the Trust can respond to and maintain clinical services in the event of a cyber incident. 

**• **The importance of maintaining awareness of data security, awareness to phishing emails and other cyber-risks have been highlighted to staff through articles in the Trust’s regular staff briefings and simulated Phishing Campaigns. 

**• **The ongoing training and awareness activities for all staff. 

**• **The sharing of learning from reported incidents and near misses. 

All of these activities are designed to help ensure that sensitive information is protected, and the risk of unintended loss or disclosure is minimised. 

Other significant risk areas that have been reviewed and will continue to be key risk areas for the year ahead are detailed below. 

**• **Imbalance of Capacity and Demand - Increasing demand for services \(specific risks on the risk register relate to Neighbourhood Teams, CAMHS, Speech and Language Therapy, ICAN\) coupled/reflected with increased complexity of the services required, resulting in potential for reduced quality of patient care, delay in treatment, deterioration in health and wellbeing of patients, and additional pressure on staff, exacerbated by vacancies to some hard to recruit to roles. 

**• **Neurodiversity waiting times - There is a risk of unsustainable Neurodevelopmental assessment and treatment pathways \(autism and ADHD\) due to demand for services surpassing the capacity resulting in unmet need of patients and long waiting lists which will cause impact to patient outcomes. 

Throughout the year the Trust has focused on the controls and mitigating actions relating to the corporate risks arising from an imbalance of capacity and demand impacting on patients and staff. For example, services are working with commissioners to develop sustainable solutions, risk-based prioritisation of waiting lists, a waiting list management programme, sharing staff wellbeing initiatives and recruitment and retention drives. 

**84**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**Data quality **and the accuracy of performance reporting, including waiting list information, is reviewed regularly. Validations on waiting list data are collected directly from services on a regular basis and reviews of other Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) happen at performance review meetings across all levels of the Trust. More specific pieces of work to test out and provide assurance around data quality are carried out on a service-by-service basis, which will be supported by the creation of a Data Quality Framework to aid consistency and accuracy of reporting. 

The Trust reports monthly on its performance against national KPIs in line with NHS 

Improvement’s Single Oversight Framework and national contract requirements. Specific service indicators in contracts are monitored monthly via internal performance monitoring processes. 

**Governance structures and accountability**

Our Board is made up of six non-executive directors \(including the Chair\), five executive directors and two non-voting members of the Board - the Director of Workforce \(job share role, and an Associate Non-Executive Director\). The Board leads the Trust by carrying out three main roles:

**• **Formulating strategy. 

**• **Holding the organisation to account for the delivery of strategy and seeking assurance that systems of control are robust and reliable. 

**• **Shaping a positive culture for the Board and the wider Trust. 

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chair and Chief Executive, and both have discharged their leadership functions throughout the whole of 2023/24. The division of responsibilities is set out in the Trust’s standing orders and standing financial instructions \(scheme of delegation section\). 

The Board held seven formal meetings in public in 2023/24. The Annual General Meeting was held in person in September 2023. Board member attendance at Board meetings is set out in the Director’s report \(starting on page 86\) and all meetings have been quorate. 

The quality of services remains the Trust’s first priority, so the Board’s agendas feature reports on our quality strategy, patient experience topics and the maintenance of safe staffing levels. Information presented to the Board provides essential assurance and our directors regularly ‘visit’ frontline services to engage with and support staff and to view the service provided to patients. 

The Board has Standing Orders, a scheme of reservation and delegation of powers and standing financial instructions. These are regularly reviewed and provide a governance framework which allows the Trust to show it is well governed and that it meets the requirements of corporate governance codes of practice. It also has an annual work plan, which schedules required and discretionary business. 

The Board discharges its responsibilities through five Committees \(see following diagram\). 

Each committee has Board-approved terms of reference and work plans which have been reviewed during 2023/24. Each committee’s minutes and assurance reports are presented at Board meetings.

A performance brief and suite of reports which mirror the five Care Quality Commission \(CQC\) domains is produced for each Board meeting so that our compliance with national and local targets can be assessed. The meetings also receive regular updates on strategic service developments, for example, work to improve how primary and secondary health services and social care work together and the introduction of new ways of working. 

Extracts from the Risk Register and the Board Assurance Framework are considered at each meeting so the Board can be assured that risks are being managed in the organisation. The extracts give timely information about existing and potential risks to the Trust. 

The Board wants to be sure that it is operating effectively and regularly seeks opportunities to evaluate its effectiveness and strengthen its performance, remaining mindful of the best practice contained within codes of governance. 

The Trust Board and committees undertake an annual self-assessment against elements of the NHS England/CQC Well-Led Framework. This assessment has drawn out a number of priorities to enhance the effectiveness of elements of the Trust’s governance. The results are reported to the Board and are contained in committees’ annual reports. 

The Trust has a needs-based Board development programme. In addition to the formal Board meetings, there was an externally facilitated Board development session focussing on cyber security, and four Board workshops during 2023/24. 

The individual performance of all Board members is reviewed through a formal appraisal process and any individual development needs are identified and supported. 

The Board’s five committees are chaired by non-executive directors and are: **Audit Committee **

**Chair: Khalil Rehman**

The Audit Committee comprises three non-executive directors, one of whom is a qualified accountant. The Associate non-executive director also joined the Committee from March 2024. The Audit Committee met formally six times during 2023/24 and is routinely attended by the Executive Director of Finance and Resources, the Company Secretary, Internal Audit and External Audit representatives. 

The Committee provides an overarching governance role and reviews the work of the other committees which provides relevant assurance to the Audit Committee’s own scope **86**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

of work. It also has responsibility for overseeing the work of the Data Protection and Cyber Security Panel, which formally changed into the Information Governance Approval Group in December 2023. The Committee receives minutes from this sub-group, receives papers on any matters escalated to it and periodically reviews the effectiveness of the sub-group. 

During the year, the Committee has received regular reports from internal audit, external audit, the local counter fraud specialist, the security management service and information governance specialists. 

The Committee has considered a range of financial control reports and a number of governance papers, and has oversight of risk management processes including the Board Assurance Framework, which it reviewed during the year. 

The Chair of each of the Board’s committees produces an annual report, which is reviewed by the Audit Committee to provide assurance to the Board that each committee has met its terms of reference during the year. Each committee undertakes a self-assessment exercise which is reported in their annual report.

**Quality Committee **

**Chair: Helen Thomson**

The Quality Committee’s membership comprises three non-executive directors and three executive directors with other senior officers also attending each meeting. The Committee met on seven occasions in 2023/24. Two additional informal meetings were held in the form of a joint workshop with members of the Quality Assurance and Improvement Group, which is a sub-group of the Committee. 

The Committee provides assurance to the Board that the Trust provides high standards of care, and that adequate and appropriate quality governance structures, processes and controls are in place to:

**87**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**• **Promote quality, in particular safety and excellence in patient care. 

**• **Identify, prioritise and manage clinical risk and assure the Board that risks and issues are being managed in a controlled and timely manner. 

**• **Ensure effective evidence-based clinical practice. 

**• **Produce the annual Quality Account and monitor progress. 

The committee exercises these functions in the context of the Trust’s Quality Strategy 2021/24 which aims to respond to challenges presented with innovation, standardisation, and a focus on improvement. 

We continue to work in a challenging landscape and the Trust ensures we continue to provide services that are clinically effective, safe, well-led, and responsive to patient’s needs, offering a positive patient experience. The Committee has received regular updates on progress with the strategy and has sought assurance about the implementation of specific actions. 

The Committee also has responsibility for overseeing the work of two subgroups: the Quality Assurance and Improvement Subgroup, and the Safeguarding Committee. 

The Quality Committee and the Board monitor serious incidents, incidents and complaints and the associated action plans. All serious incidents are managed in accordance with the Trust’s Incident Management Policy \(including Serious Incidents\).

**Business Committee **

**Chair: Richard Gladman \(to October 2023\) / Rachel Booth \(from November 2023\)** The Business Committee’s membership comprises three non-executive directors, the associate non-executive director, the Chief Executive and two further executives. Other senior officers attend as required. The Business Committee held 10 meetings in 2023/24. 

**88**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

The Committee provides assurance to the Board on the financial and performance management processes within the organisation, including monitoring the delivery of the Trust’s business plan and oversight of significant projects. 

The Committee oversees business and commercial developments and makes investment decisions in line with the Scheme of Delegation and the Trust’s Investment Policy. It also ensures that the Board has a sufficiently robust understanding of key performance, financial and investment issues to enable sound decision-making. 

The Committee discharges a significant role in overseeing the workforce aspects of the Trust’s performance. During 2023/24 the Committee considered recruitment and retention initiatives, sickness absence management and leadership approaches. It also has responsibility for overseeing the work of the Health and Safety Group. This Group provides an overarching view of health and safety and ensures that the Trust complies with its health and safety obligations by monitoring adherence with its policies and procedures. 

The Committee receives minutes from the Health and Safety Group and papers on any matters escalated to it. It also periodically reviews the effectiveness of the Health and Safety Group in discharging its delegated responsibilities. 

The Committee has assumed an extended role in terms of oversight of the Trust’s change programmes. The committee receives in-depth reports from the programme leads and reports from the Change Board, which provides an overview of inter-connectivity for the main programmes and related projects.

**Chair: Brodie Clark CBE**

The Nominations and Remuneration Committee’s membership comprises the Chair and two further non-executive directors; the Committee is supported by the Director of Workforce. The Committee has met four times in 2023/24. 

The role of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee is to nominate executive directors, including the Chief Executive, for appointment and advise and make recommendations to the Board about appropriate remuneration and terms of service for the Chief Executive, executive directors, directors and any senior managers not covered by national Agenda for Change terms and conditions of employment. 

The Committee also gives full consideration to, and make plans for, succession planning for the Chief Executive and other executive directors taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing the Trust and the skills and expertise needed. 

It monitors and reviews any exceptional and/or significant employee relations cases which are high risk to the Trust, including high-cost employment cases or of reputational significance. 

The Committee ratifies and agrees any awards at the discretion of the Trust as the employer. One such duty is to review the nominations for the Clinical Excellence Awards and to encourage maximum participation from staff across the eligible consultant body. 

In 2023/24 the Committee approved the recommendations for the remuneration of the interim Director appointments, supported the recruitment of the substantive Chief Executive and continued to support various staff financial incentive schemes which were targeted responses to the challenging workforce situation.

**Incident reporting and learning from incidents**

The Trust has a strong, open incident reporting culture. An electronic incident reporting system is operational throughout the organisation and is accessible to all colleagues. 

Incident reporting is promoted through induction and a suite of training has been developed in alignment with the implementation of the Patient Safety Incident Response Framework \(PSIRF\). Work continues to strengthen learning from incidents in a coordinated centralised way. In addition to digital repositories, the Trust has service level and Trust-wide forums for sharing including the monthly Making Stuff Better sessions and quarterly Safety summits. The Trust Board approved the Patient Safety incident Response Plan \(PSIRP\) in February 2024 which describes the Trust approach to learning and improvement, and the Trust is introducing new learning response tools to support a proportionate approach to learning from incidents. 

An internal audit during 2023 found some good practice but made a series of recommendations to improve the way that the Trust shares, embeds and provides evidence of learning from adverse incidents. 

**Safe, sustainable and effective staffing**

The Trust has a range of strategies, systems and processes in place to ensure safe, sustainable and effective staffing. The overall approach to workforce is described in the Trust’s Workforce Strategy, which is aligned with the Trust’s strategic goals and priorities, responding to external, internal, and cultural factors including market conditions which are currently \(or anticipated\) to impact on our workforce requirements. Its primary aim is to attract, develop and retain the best people in order to deliver outstanding care. 

The Workforce Strategy’s key themes are outlined below, all of which contribute to safe, sustainable and effective staffing:

\#TeamLeeds. 

Progress on delivery of the Workforce Strategy’s priorities is overseen by the Board, with the Business Committee providing additional scrutiny and assurance. 

The Trust’s Workforce Plan supports the delivery of our operational business plan and is embedded in service needs. It is also triangulated with finance and activity data. The Plan is updated each year and is signed off by both the Business Committee and the Board at a meeting in public. 

The Board receives a twice-yearly Safe Staffing report from the Executive Director of Nursing and Allied Health Professionals, in line with the National Quality Board’s 2016 

guidance incorporating professional judgement and outcomes. Quarterly reports are also received at Board from the Guardian for Safe Working Hours. 

Workforce data is an important part of the Trust’s business continuity approach, with daily, real-time workforce and capacity information informing decision making and planning. 

Triangulation of data including financial, workforce and activity/performance information, takes place at the Trust Leadership Team meeting and at the Board and its subcommittees’ 

**92**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

meetings, to ensure comprehensive oversight of staffing and any issues arising. 

Our services grow and develop as we deliver new pathways of care, and care for more and more people in the community. Any new service or service change is subject to a Quality Impact Assessment \(QIA\) which includes any new roles which create a significant change to the way care is delivered. 

**CQC compliance**

The Trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission. 

**Register of Interests**

The Trust has published on its website an up-to-date register of interests, including gifts and hospitality, for decision-making staff \(as defined by the Trust with reference to the guidance\) within the past twelve months, as required by the **‘Managing Conflicts of** **Interest in the NHS’** guidance. 

**NHS pension obligations**

As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer’s contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. 

**Equality and diversity**

Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation’s obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. 

The Trust has a legal obligation under the Equality Act 2010 and Public Sector Equality Duty to provide equality in access to service provision and within employment. 

The Board receives in-depth analysis and updates on a range of proactive work around this wider agenda through the Workforce Strategy. This includes delivery against the Workforce Race Equality Standard \(WRES\) action plan and the Workforce Disability Equality Standard \(WDES\) Action Plan. The Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Forum, which is chaired by the Trust’s Chair, continues to bring employee perspectives, experiences and ideas in pursuit of our ambition to be much more representative of our communities and to further tackle and reduce outstanding issues of disparity in staff experience. The Trust also has three staff networks: Disability, Neurodiversity and Long-Term Conditions, LGBTQIA\+; and the Race Equality Network. 

**Climate Change**

The Trust has undertaken risk assessments on the effects of climate change and severe weather and has developed a Green Plan following the guidance of the Greener NHS 

**93**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

programme. The Trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are complied with. 

**Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of **

**resources**

The Trust has consistently met the financial targets set by its regulators. 

The Board sets an annual budget to meet the Trust’s financial obligations. For 2023/24 

revenue and capital resources were agreed between the Trust and its commissioners enabling the Board to agree a budget to deliver balance revenue and capital plans. The revenue plan was subsequently amended to a £250k surplus by agreement with the West Yorkshire ICS in November 2023. 

Throughout the year the Trust worked in collaboration with partner organisations in Leeds and across the West Yorkshire ICS to ensure that best use was made of NHS resources. 

The Trust maintained its financial governance arrangements throughout 2023/24 with the Business Committee and Board continuing to receive financial reports at each of their meetings, and the Audit Committee receiving assurances on financial governance from management, internal and external auditors. 

Under the National Audit Office Code of Audit Practice, the external auditor is required to consider if the Trust has proper arrangements in place to deliver value for money in its use of resources and provides a commentary on those arrangements. 

On the basis of the work reported to Audit Committee in 2023/24 the external auditor has not identified any significant weaknesses in the Trust’s value for money arrangements. 

The effectiveness of the Trust’s services is regularly assessed by the Trust’s Quality Committee and by the Board. 

**Information Governance**

Compliance with Data Protection legislation, data security, data ownership and transparency are of paramount importance to the Trust. The Trust is committed to ensuring that personal data is protected, and any confidential data is used appropriately and ethically. 

The Trust complies with the relevant legislation and national codes of practice and actively supports the transparency of information. The Trust complies with the UK General Data Protection Regulation \(UK GDPR\) and employs a Data Protection Officer \(DPO\). The DPO 

duties include:

**• **Promoting the organisation’s responsibilities, which empowers the organisation to be compliant with the Data Protection legislation. 

**• **Ensuring there is subject matter expert provision for internal and external stakeholders to achieve compliance with privacy and information security in relation to the organisation activities. 

**94**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**• **Protecting information, its integrity and availability throughout the lifecycle of the information. 

The Senior Information Risk Owner \(SIRO\) ensures that there is effective information governance in place. The SIRO chairs the Information Governance Approval Group which reports quarterly to the Audit Committee and in turn to the Board. The Caldicott Guardian is the Deputy Chair of the Information Governance Approval Group, and works closely with the SIRO and the DPO, particularly where there are any identified information risks relating to patient data. 

The Trust ensures effective information governance through a number of technical and organisational controls including education, policies and procedures, IT / information security controls, IT vulnerability testing, and by demonstrating annual compliance with the Data Security Standards of the Data Security and Protection Toolkit \(DSPT\). 

The Trust demonstrates compliance with the 10 Data Security Standards, an outcome from the National Data Guardians’ ‘Review of data security, consent and opt outs’ report, via a self-assessment within the Data Security and Protection Toolkit \(DSPT\). This submission is independently audited. 

In recognition of the importance of data security, there is a target of 95% of staff compliance with information governance training. Training compliance is closely monitored, reminder emails are sent, and system lockouts are enforced where necessary. 

All incidents relating to a potential breach of personal data are reported, investigated and, where appropriate, remedial actions are implemented. The Trust reported three incidents to the Information Commissioner’s Office \(ICO\) during 2023/24. 

**Details of the incidents are:** 

The first breach occurred when a complaint response letter was sent to an incorrect address twice and the eventual disposition of the letter was unknown due to the passage of time. The ICO confirmed that it was satisfied with the Trust’s response, particularly regarding transparency and attempts to locate the letter and confirmed that no further action would be taken. 

The second breach happened when a Bank Member of staff accessed the records of her mother-in-law on two occasions, in the knowledge that this would be against her wishes. 

The ICO was satisfied with the Trust’s response, particularly regarding the disciplinary actions taken and confirmed that no further action would be taken. 

The third breach took place when a copy of records provided to a patient contained GP 

data in addition to LCH data, due to ‘share in’ status of the SystmOne record. No further action was required from the ICO. 

**Data Quality and Governance**

Data quality and the accuracy of performance reporting, including waiting list information, is reviewed regularly. Validations on waiting list data are collected directly from services on a regular basis and reviews of other Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) happen at performance review meetings across all levels of the Trust. More specific **95**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

pieces of work to test out and provide assurance around data quality are carried out on a service-by-service basis, which is being supported by the implementation of a Data Quality Framework to aid consistency and accuracy of reporting. 

The Trust reports monthly on its performance against national KPIs in line with NHS 

Improvement’s Single Oversight Framework and national contract requirements. Specific service indicators in contracts are monitored monthly via internal performance monitoring processes. 

In addition to the operation of the risk management strategy, risk management is embedded in the Trust in a number of ways, for example:

**• **There is a lessons learnt portal on the ‘Making Stuff Better’ page on the Trust’s intranet, where managers can share information about incidents, learning and improvements. 

**• **The risk manager provides guidance, support and training to staff appropriate to their authority and duties. 

**• **Trust employees receive training in equality and diversity, and quality and equality impact assessments are completed for all strategy, policies, and business cases so that the full impact on protected groups is identified and taken into account. 

**• **The Trust has policies in place to encourage employees to highlight risks and report concerns, for example through the whistleblowing policy. 

**Review of effectiveness**

As Accountable Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS trust that have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the information provided in this annual report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Board and the Audit Committee and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. 

The Chief Executive has responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. The review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of internal auditors, the comments made by external auditors in the ISA260 report, the continuing engagement of the Audit Committee, managers and clinical leads who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. The Audit Committee undertakes a role in terms of providing assurance to the Chief Executive. 

**Quality Account**

The directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service \(Quality Accounts\) Regulations 2010 \(as amended\) to prepare Quality Accounts for each **96**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

financial year. 

The Quality Account is a separate report and describes the quality of services offered by an NHS healthcare provider. The Quality Account is an important way for local NHS 

services to report on quality and highlight improvements in the services delivered to local communities and stakeholders. The quality of the services is measured by looking at patient safety, the effectiveness of the treatments that patients receive, and patient feedback about the care provided. 

The Quality Account priorities for LCH have been developed in conjunction with stakeholders, services and senior managers. These priorities will make sure that Trust activity drives improvements in services for all communities, stakeholders and aligns to the Quality Strategy and business objectives. The Quality Account highlights a selection of initiatives, clinical practice and events that have happened throughout the year to reflect the commitment and drive to provide the best possible standards of care throughout all services. 

The Trust recognises the complex needs of its community and strives to achieve consistent delivery of high-quality care to maximise patient safety and experience. The Quality Account seeks to provide a balanced view of the Trust’s achievements and areas for improvement. The Trust acknowledges the developments it continues to make and the collaborative work with partners to make real progress across the whole health economy. 

The Trust has robust systems and processes to ensure the accuracy of data provided in the Quality Account, including waiting time data. This includes data cleansing and data validation processes as well as oversight arrangements provided by committees and committee subgroups. 

**Internal audit**

Audit Yorkshire has been the provider of the Trust’s internal audit services since 1 April 2022. The overall Head of Internal Audit opinion for the 2023/24 reporting period provides Significant Assurance, that there is a good system of internal control designed to meet the organisation’s objectives, and that controls are generally being applied consistently. 

This opinion is based solely on the matters that came to the attention of Audit Yorkshire during the course of the internal audit reviews carried out during the year and is not an opinion on all elements of the risk management, control and governance processes or the ongoing financial viability or the ability to meet financial obligations which must be obtained by Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust from its various sources of assurance. 

In areas where the effectiveness of internal control arrangements provided less than 

‘substantial’ assurance, internal audit recommendations were made to further strengthen the control environment. The resulting management actions, which are monitored by the Audit Committee, have been completed or are being progressed in a satisfactory manner. 

During 2023/24 it must be noted that gaps in leadership and capacity, particularly within the Executive Team, had proved challenging and impacted on the delivery of the audit plan and resulting Head of Internal Audit opinion. 

**External audit**

**97**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Mazars LLP were appointed as the Trust’s external auditors in 2020/21 following a formal tender process carried out by the Auditor Appointment Panel and approved by Trust Board. The agreed contract period was three \+ one \+ one years. 

**Clinical audit**

Clinical audit is vital to the quality and effectiveness of clinical services and is a fundamental part of the quality improvement process. It plays a pivotal role in providing assurances about the quality of services. Findings from clinical audit are used to ensure that action is taken to protect patients from risks associated with unsafe care, treatment and support. 

Clinical audit is managed at service level with the support of the quality and professional development directorate. The Quality Committee approves an annual programme of clinical audit and has oversight of progress during the course of the year. 

During 2023/24 four national clinical audits covered the NHS services that the Trust provides. During that period, the Trust participated in 100% of national clinical audits More information about these is in our Quality Account \(separate document\). 

**Working in collaboration**

Partnership working is one of LCH’s strategic goals: Collaborating with partners to enable people to live better lives, and most services deliver some part of their service in partnership – from informal arrangements to more formal partnership agreements. 

We recognise the importance of collaborative working and the benefits that integration can bring for our service users, patient and carers. The Trust is a member of a number of collaboratives on a West Yorkshire footprint including the Mental Health, Learning Disability and Autism Collaboration, and the Community Health Services Provider Collaborative. Partnership working with the Voluntary and Community Sector \(VCS\) is described and delivered through our third sector strategy. 

**Working at System level: West Yorkshire Health and Care **

**Partnership \(WYH&CP\), an integrated care system**

Over the last 12 months the Trust has continued to be actively involved in the development of the WYH&CP. 

The Partnership is made up of the NHS, councils, hospices, Healthwatch, the voluntary community social enterprise sector. The Partnership supports 2.4 million people, living in urban and rural areas. 

The WYH&CP takes a place-based approach across Bradford District and Craven; Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds, and Wakefield that highlights the strengths, capacity, and knowledge of all those involved. This way of working is supported by West Yorkshire wide priority programmes, such as cancer, maternity, mental health, urgent care, tackling health inequalities, children and young people. The Partnership provides greater opportunities **98**

to deliver the Five-Year Plan ambitions, ensuring that all people are given the best start in life, are able to remain healthy and age well. 

**Leeds Health and Care Partnership \(LHCP\) **

***“We know that people’s lives are better when those who deliver health and ***

***care work together.” ***

The Leeds Health and Care Partnership \(LHCP\) includes health and care organisations from across Leeds who are working together to improve the health of people in Leeds. The LHCP understands that by listening to people, and by sharing knowledge and resources, it can make a bigger difference to people’s lives. 

Represented through the LCH Chief Executive, The Leeds Committee of the West Yorkshire Integrated Care Board makes decisions about the best way to allocate resources across the City that will have the biggest impact on improving health outcomes, people’s experiences and reducing health inequalities. 

**NHS England oversight**

NHS England has assigned the Trust a segment rating of ‘2’ which indicates standard oversight whereby the provider may be offered targeted support in one or more areas. 

The Trust works with a range of regulators including the CQC, HM Inspectorate of Prisons, and Ofsted. 

**Conclusion**

The Trust is a well-established health care provider that has built a system of internal control on sound foundations. The Trust has a strong safety culture and sees quality of care as its primary objective. Ongoing scrutiny enhances learning and strengthens governance. 

The annual governance statement demonstrates that the Trust has the necessary control arrangements in place to manage risks and takes action when incidents occur. 

Strong financial control and the achievement of statutory financial duties support the view that, clinically and financially, the Trust has effective and improving systems in place. 

During 2023/24, no significant control issues have been identified by the Trust’s systems of internal control.

**Cash Equivalent Transfer Values **

A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value \(CETV\) is the actuarially assessed capital value of the pension scheme benefits accrued by a member at a particular point in time. The benefits valued are the member’s accrued benefits and any contingent spouse’s \(or other allowable beneficiary’s\) pension payable from the scheme. CETVs are calculated in accordance with Statutory Instrument 2008 number 1050 Occupational Pension Schemes \(Transfer Values\) Regulations 2008. 

Cash equivalent transfer value \(CETV\) figures are calculated using the guidance on discount rates for calculating unfunded public service contribution rates that was extant on 31 March 2024. 

**Real increase in CETV**

This reflects the increase in CETV effectively funded by the employer. It does not include the increase in accrued pension due to inflation, contributions paid by the employee \(including the value of any benefits transferred from another scheme or arrangement\). 

**Payments to past directors \(subject to audit\) **

There have been no payments made to past directors. 

**Fair pay disclosures**** \(subject to audit\)** Reporting bodies are required to disclose the relationship between the remuneration and salary of the highest paid director in their organisation and the median and 25th and 75th percentiles remuneration and salary of the organisation’s workforce.

The Trust is proud to say it achieved a record response rate of 61.7% overall. We have consistently achieved improved response rates over the last four years and maintained or slightly improved on engagement or morale scores. For 2023 there were increased engagement scores for the overall Trust and across all Business Units. The engagement score is significant as there are correlations between staff engagement, patient experience and patient outcomes. For this reason, it is used to compare each NHS Trust with others and is used by the CQC in their Well-Led assessments. Our scores for engagement and morale are well above the national average \(6.9 engagement and 5.9 morale\) and in line with community sector.

**Independent auditor’s report to the Directors **

**of Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust**

**Report on the audit of the financial statements**

**Opinion on the financial statements**

We have audited the financial statements of Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust \(‘the Trust’\) for the year ended 31 March 2024, which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Changes in Taxpayers’ 

Equity, the Statement of Cash Flows and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and international accounting standards as interpreted and adapted by HM Treasury’s Financial Reporting Manual 2023/24 as contained in the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual 2023/24, and the Accounts Direction issued by the Secretary of State with the approval of HM 

Treasury as relevant to NHS Trusts in England. 

In our opinion, the financial statements:

**• **give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Trust as at 31 March 2024 and of its income and expenditure for the year then ended; 

**• **have been properly prepared in accordance with the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual 2023/24; and

**• **have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Health Service Act 2006. 

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing \(UK\) \(ISAs \(UK\)\) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities section of our report. We are independent of the Trust in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. 

Based on the work we have performed, and taking into account the requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Trust’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. 

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. 

**114**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

**Other information **

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 

We have nothing to report in this regard. 

**Responsibilities of the Directors and the Accountable Officer for the financial** **statements **

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the Accounts, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are required to comply with the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual 2023/24 

and prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, unless the Trust is informed of the intention for dissolution without transfer of services or function to another public sector entity. The Directors are responsible for assessing each year whether or not it is appropriate for the Trust to prepare its accounts on the going concern basis and disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. 

As explained in the Statement of the Chief Executive’s Responsibilities as the Accountable Officer of the Trust, the Accountable Officer is responsible for such internal control as the Accountable Officer determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Accountable Officer is responsible for ensuring that the financial statements are prepared in a format directed by the Secretary of State. 

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements** Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs \(UK\) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed on the next page. 

**115**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. 

We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. Based on our understanding of the Trust, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the National Health Service Act 2006 \(as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2012\), and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. 

To help us identify instances of non-compliance with these laws and regulations, and in identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect to non-compliance, our procedures included, but were not limited to:

**• **inquiring with management and the Audit Committee, as to whether the Trust is in compliance with laws and regulations, and discussing their policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations; 

**• **communicating identified laws and regulations throughout our engagement team and remaining alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout our audit; and

**• **considering the risk of acts by the Trust which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. 

We evaluated the Accountable Officer’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements \(including the risk of override of controls\) and determined that the principal risks were related to posting manual journal entries to manipulate financial performance, management bias through judgements and assumptions in significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to year end expenditure accruals, significant one-off or unusual transactions and the risk of fraud in revenue and expenditure recognition. 

Our audit procedures in relation to fraud included but were not limited to:

**• **making enquiries of management and the Audit Committee on whether they had knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; 

**• **gaining an understanding of the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud; 

**• **discussing amongst the engagement team the risks of fraud; 

**• **addressing the risks of fraud through management override of controls by performing journal entry testing, testing of accounting estimates, and consideration of any significant transactions outside the normal course of business; and

**• **addressing the risk of fraud through revenue and expenditure recognition by testing a sample of income and expenditure transactions around the year-end, testing year end accruals and year end receivables. 

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of irregularities including fraud rests with management and the Audit Committee. As with any audit, there remained a risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal controls. 

**116**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

We are also required to conclude on whether the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. We performed our work in accordance with Practice Note 10: Audit of financial statements and regularity of public sector bodies in the United Kingdom, and Supplementary Guidance Note 01, issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General in April 2021. 

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 

**www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities**. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. 

**Report on the Trust’s arrangements for securing economy, **

**efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources**

**Matter on which we are required to report by exception**

We are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we are not satisfied that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources for the year ended 31 March 2024. 

We have nothing to report in this respect. 

**Responsibilities of the Accountable Officer**

As explained in the Statement of Accountable Officer’s responsibilities, the Accountable Officer is responsible for putting in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of the Trust’s resources. 

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the review of arrangements for securing economy,** **efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources**

We are required under section 21 of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 \(as amended\) to satisfy ourselves that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources, and to report where we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that it has done so. We are not required to consider, nor have we considered, whether all aspects of the Trust’s arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources are operating effectively. 

We have undertaken our work in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice, having regard to the guidance issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General in May 2024. 

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements **

**Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Code of Audit Practice** In our opinion: 

**• **the parts of the Remuneration and Staff Report subject to audit have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounts Direction made under the National Health Service Act 2006; and

**• **the other information published together with the audited financial statements in the Annual Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 

**117**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**



**Matters on which we are required to report by exception under the Code of Audit** **Practice **

We are required to report to you if: 

**• **in our opinion the Annual Governance Statement does not comply with the guidance issued by NHS England; or

**• **we refer a matter to the Secretary of State under section 30 of the Local Audit and Accountability Act; or

**• **we issue a report in the public interest under section 24 and schedule 7\(1\) of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014; or

**• **we make a written recommendation to the Trust under section 24 and schedule 7\(2\) of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014. 

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 

**Use of the audit report **

This report is made solely to the Board of Directors of Leeds Community Healthcare NHS 

Trust, as a body, in accordance with part 5 of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014. 

Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Directors of the Trust those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Directors of the Trust, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 

**Certificate**

We certify that we have completed the audit of Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust in accordance with the requirements of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 and the Code of Audit Practice.

**Information on reserves**

**Public dividend capital**

Public dividend capital \(PDC\) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS organisation. Additional PDC may also be issued to Trusts by the Department of Health and Social Care. A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the Trust, is payable to the Department of Health as the public dividend capital dividend. 

**Revaluation reserve**

Increases in asset values arising from revaluations are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse impairments previously recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating income. Subsequent downward movements in asset valuations are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain was recognised unless the downward movement represents a clear consumption of economic benefit or a reduction in service potential. 

**Other reserves**

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust does not hold a financial assets \(available for sale\) reserve, a merger reserve or any other reserves not specifially included in the taxpayers' equity. 

**Income and expenditure reserve**

The balance of this reserve is the accumulated surpluses and deficits of the Trust.

**Notes to the Accounts**

**1Note 1 Accounting policies and other information**

1**Note 1.1 Basis of preparation**

The Department of Health and Social Care has directed that the financial statements of the Trust shall meet the accounting requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual \(GAM\), which shall be agreed with HM Treasury. Consequently, the following financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the GAM 2023/24 issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. The accounting policies contained in the GAM 

fol ow International Financial Reporting Standards to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to the NHS, as determined by HM Treasury, which is advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. Where the GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judged to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Trust for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adopted are described below. These have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts. 

**Accounting convention**

These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. 

**Note 1.2 Going concern**

These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial reporting framework applicable to NHS 

bodies, derived from the HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual, defines that the anticipated continued provision of the entity’s services in the public sector is normally sufficient evidence of going concern. The directors have a reasonable expectation that this wil continue to be the case. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust Board specifically considered the matter of going concern at its Board meeting on 28 March 2024. The Trust Board concluded that after considering the matters in the paper and having an awareness of all relevant information, that there are no material uncertainties related to events or conditions which may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Trust to continue as a going concern. 

**Note 1.3 Interests in other entities**

**Joint operations**

Joint operations are arrangements in which the Trust has joint control with one or more other parties and has the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust includes within its financial statements its share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust provides the following services as lead provider. The contract income flows to the Trust and the relevant partner recharges expenditure associated with the provision of the service. Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust distributes a share of any profit or loss to the relevant partner.

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust provides a community care beds service under a joint operation with Leeds City Council. The Trust is the lead provider and contract income flows to the Trust. Leeds City Council recharges expenditure associated with the service. The total cost of this service is recognised by Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust provides a 10 bed dementia service under a joint operation with Leeds City Council. Leeds City Council is the lead provider and contract income flows to them. Leeds Community Healthcare NHS 

Trust recharges expenditure associated with the service to Leeds City Council. 

**NHS Charitable Fund**

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust is the Corporate Trustee to the Leeds Community Healthcare Charitable Trust. The Trust has assessed its relationship to the charitable fund and determined it to be a subsidiary because the Trust is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns and other benefits for itself, patients and staff from its involvement with the charitable fund and has the ability to affect those returns and other benefits through its power over the fund. 

Leeds Community Healthcare Trust has decided not to consolidate the charitable funds into these accounts as the transactions and balances are not material. 

**126**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Page 9

**Note 1.4 Revenue from contracts with customers** Where income is derived from contracts with customers, it is accounted for under IFRS 15. The GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which enables an entity to receive cash or another financial asset that is not classified as a tax by the Office of National Statistics \(ONS\). 

Revenue in respect of goods / services provided is recognised when \(or as\) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised goods / services to the customer and is measured at the amount of the transaction price allocated to those performance obligations. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to performance obligations satisfied in that year. Where the Trust’s entitlement to consideration for those goods or services is unconditional a contract receivable wil be recognised. Where entitlement to consideration is conditional on a further factor other than the passage of time, a contract asset wil be recognised. Where consideration received or receivable relates to a performance obligation that is to be satisfied in a future period, the income is deferred and recognised as a contract liability. 

**Revenue from NHS contracts**

The main source of income for Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust is contracts with commissioners for health care services and is in the form of aligned payment and incentive contracts, the main form of contracting between NHS 

providers and their commissioners for 2023/24. Funding envelopes are set at an Integrated Care Board \(ICB\) level. The majority of the Trust’s NHS income is earned from NHS commissioners under the NHS Payment Scheme \(NHSPS\) which replaced the National Tariff Payment System on 1 April 2023. The Trust agreed fixed element payments with commissioners, based on funding for an agreed level of activity. The fixed element also included CQUIN funding of 1.25% of the contract value. 

In addition, where the relationship with a particular integrated care board is expected to be a low volume of activity \(annual value below £0.5m\), an annual fixed payment is received. The LVA payments schedule was provided nationally and identified those relationships where, on the basis of historical activity, the annual value of activity between the ICB and the Trust for 2023/24 is expected to be below £500,000. 

In addition the Trust received additional non recurrent income during the financial year to reimburse specific costs incurred. 

**127**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Page 10

**Revenue from non-NHS contracts**

Revenue is recognised by Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust from non-NHS commissioners for health care services under IFRS 15. The revenue is recognised as and when performance obligations are satisfied. 

The performance obligation relating to the delivery of the health care is satisfied over the time the healthcare is received and consumed simultaneously by the customer, as the Trust performs it. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to activity delivered in that year. 

Where Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust is aware of a penalty based on contractual performance, the Trust reflects this in the transaction price for its recognition of revenue. Revenue is reduced by the value of the penalty. 

5 **Note 1.5 Other forms of income**

**Grants and donations**

Government grants are grants from government bodies other than income from commissioners or Trusts for the provision of services. Where a grant is used to fund revenue expenditure it is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to match that expenditure. Where a grant is used to fund capital expenditure, it is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income once conditions attached to the grant have been met. Donations are treated in the same way as government grants. 

**Other income**

Within the other income category, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust includes any income received in the period not identified separately. It includes categories such as rental income, recruitment support, joint project income, lease car income and employee salary sacrifice VAT income. 

6 **Note 1.6 Expenditure on employee benefits**

**Short-term employee benefits**

Salaries, wages and employment-related payments such as social security costs and the apprenticeship levy are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees. The cost of annual leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at the end of the period is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that employees are permitted to carry-forward leave into the following period. 

**Pension costs **

NHS Pension Scheme

Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the two NHS Pension Schemes. Both schemes are unfunded, defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, general practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in England and Wales. The scheme is not designed in a way that would enable employers to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. 

Therefore, the scheme is accounted for as though it is a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the Trust is taken as equal to the employer's pension contributions payable to the scheme for the accounting period. The contributions are charged to operating expenses as and when they become due. 

Additional pension liabilities arising from early retirements are not funded by the scheme except where the retirement is due to il -health. The full amount of the liability for the additional costs is charged to the operating expenses at the time the Trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of the method of payment. 

7 **Note 1.7 Expenditure on other goods and services**

Expenditure on goods and services is recognised when, and to the extent that they have been received, and is measured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure is recognised in operating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non-current asset such as property, plant and equipment. 

**128**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Page 11

**Note 1.8 Property, plant and equipment**

**Recognition**

Property, plant and equipment is capitalised where: 

• it is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes

• it is probable that future economic benefits wil flow to, or service potential be provided to, the trust

• it is expected to be used for more than one financial year 

• the cost of the item can be measured reliably

• the item has cost of at least £5,000, or

• collectively, a number of items have a cost of at least £5,000 and individually have cost of more than £250, where the assets are functionally interdependent, have broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have similar disposal dates and are under single managerial control. 

Where a large asset, for example a building, includes a number of components with significantly different asset lives, eg, plant and equipment, then these components are treated as separate assets and depreciated over their own useful lives. 

*Subsequent expenditure*

Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that additional future economic benefits or service potential deriving from the cost incurred to replace a component of such item wil flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be determined reliably. Where a component of an asset is replaced, the cost of the replacement is capitalised if it meets the criteria for recognition above. The carrying amount of the part replaced is de-recognised. Other expenditure that does not generate additional future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance, is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred. 

**Measurement**

*Valuation*

All property, plant and equipment assets are measured initially at cost, representing the costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. 

Assets are measured subsequently at valuation. Assets which are held for their service potential and are in use \(ie operational assets used to deliver either front line services or back office functions\) are measured at their current value in existing use. Assets that were most recently held for their service potential but are surplus with no plan to bring them back into use are measured at fair value where there are no restrictions on sale at the reporting date and where they do not meet the definitions of investment properties or assets held for sale. 

Revaluations of property, plant and equipment are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that carrying values are not materially different from those that would be determined at the end of the reporting period. Current values in existing use are determined as follows:

• 

Land and non-specialised buildings – market value for existing use

• 

Specialised buildings – depreciated replacement cost on a modern equivalent asset basis. 

For specialised assets, current value in existing use is interpreted as the present value of the asset's remaining service potential, which is assumed to be at least equal to the cost of replacing that service potential. Specialised assets are therefore valued at their depreciated replacement cost \(DRC\) on a modern equivalent asset \(MEA\) basis. An MEA basis assumes that the asset wil be replaced with a modern asset of equivalent capacity and meeting the location requirements of the services being provided. 

Properties in the course of construction for service or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, where capitalised in accordance with IAS 23, borrowings costs. Assets are revalued and depreciation commences when the assets are brought into use. 

IT equipment, transport equipment, furniture and fittings, and plant and machinery that are held for operational use are valued at depreciated historic cost where these assets have short useful lives or low values or both, as this is not considered to be materially different from current value in existing use. 

**129**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Page 12

*Depreciation*

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their remaining useful lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Freehold land is considered to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. 

Property, plant and equipment which has been reclassified as ‘held for sale’ cease to be depreciated upon the reclassification. Assets in the course of construction and residual interests in off-Statement of Financial Position PFI contract assets are not depreciated until the asset is brought into use or reverts to the trust, respectively. 

*Revaluation gains and losses*

Revaluation gains are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease that has previously been recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating expenditure. 

Revaluation losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is an available balance for the asset concerned, and thereafter are charged to operating expenses. 

Gains and losses recognised in the revaluation reserve are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an item of ‘other comprehensive income’. 

*Impairments*

In accordance with the GAM, impairments that arise from a clear consumption of economic benefits or of service potential in the asset are charged to operating expenses. A compensating transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amount equal to the lower of \(i\) the impairment charged to operating expenses; and \(i \) the balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that asset before the impairment. 

An impairment that arises from a clear consumption of economic benefit or of service potential is reversed when, and to the extent that, the circumstances that gave rise to the loss is reversed. Reversals are recognised in operating expenditure to the extent that the asset is restored to the carrying amount it would have had if the impairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal is recognised in the revaluation reserve. Where, at the time of the original impairment, a transfer was made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount is transferred back to the revaluation reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. 

Other impairments are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of ‘other impairments’ are treated as revaluation gains. 

**130**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Page 13

**De-recognition**

Assets intended for disposal are reclassified as ‘held for sale’ once the criteria in IFRS 5 are met. The sale must be highly probable and the asset available for immediate sale in its present condition. 

Fol owing reclassification, the assets are measured at the lower of their existing carrying amount and their ‘fair value less costs to sell’. Depreciation ceases to be charged and the assets are not revalued, except where the 'fair value less costs to sell' falls below the carrying amount. Assets are de-recognised when al material sale contract conditions have been met. 

Property, plant and equipment which is to be scrapped or demolished does not qualify for recognition as ‘held for sale’ 

and instead is retained as an operational asset and the asset’s useful life is adjusted. The asset is de-recognised when scrapping or demolition occurs. 

**Donated and grant funded assets**

Donated and grant funded property, plant and equipment assets are capitalised at their fair value on receipt. The donation / grant is credited to income at the same time, unless the donor has imposed a condition that the future economic benefits embodied in the grant are to be consumed in a manner specified by the donor, in which case, the donation/grant is deferred within liabilities and is carried forward to future financial years to the extent that the condition has not yet been met. 

The donated and grant funded assets are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other items of property, plant and equipment. 

This includes assets donated to Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust by the Department of Health and Social Care or NHS England as part of the response to the coronavirus pandemic. As defined in the GAM, the Trust applies the principle of donated asset accounting to assets that the Trust controls and is obtaining economic benefits from at the year end.

**Note 1.9 Intangible assets **

**Recognition**

Intangible assets are non-monetary assets without physical substance which are capable of being sold separately from the rest of the Trust’s business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only where it is probable that future economic benefits wil flow to, or service potential be provided to, the trust and where the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 

*Internally generated intangible assets*

Internally generated goodwil , brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and similar items are not capitalised as intangible assets. 

Expenditure on research is not capitalised. 

Expenditure on development is capitalised where it meets the requirements set out in IAS 38. 

*Software*

Software which is integral to the operation of hardware, eg an operating system, is capitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software which is not integral to the operation of hardware, eg application software, is capitalised as an intangible asset. 

**Measurement**

Intangible assets are recognised initially at cost, comprising al directly attributable costs needed to create, produce and prepare the asset to the point that it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. 

Subsequently intangible assets are measured at current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are valued at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and the value in use, where the asset is income generating. Revaluations gains and losses and impairments are treated in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. An intangible asset, which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use, is valued at fair value where there are no restrictions on sale at the reporting date, and where they do not meet the definitions of investment properties or assets held for sale. 

Intangible assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. 

*Amortisation*

Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. 

**Useful lives of intangible assets **

Useful lives reflect the total life of an asset and not the remaining life of an asset. The range of useful lives are shown in the table below:

**Note 1.10 Inventories **

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust does not hold inventories and the cost of inventory items are expensed through the income and expenditure account. 

During 2023/24 Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust received inventories including personal protective equipment from the Department of Health and Social Care. In line with the GAM and applying the principles of the IFRS Conceptual Framework, the Trust has accounted for the receipt of these inventories at an estimated cost, reflecting the best available approximation of an imputed market value for the transaction based on the cost of acquisition by the Department. 

**Note 1.11 Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash is cash in hand and deposits with any financial institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are investments that mature in 3 months or less from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. 

In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of the Trust’s cash management. Cash, bank and overdraft balances are recorded at current values. 

**Note 1.12 Financial assets and financial liabilities**

**Recognition**

Financial assets and financial liabilities arise where the Trust is party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument, and as a result has a legal right to receive or a legal obligation to pay cash or another financial instrument. The GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which give rise to arrangements that in all other respects would be a financial instrument and do not give rise to transactions classified as a tax by ONS. 

This includes the purchase or sale of non-financial items \(such as goods or services\), which are entered into in accordance with the Trust’s normal purchase, sale or usage requirements and are recognised when, and to the extent which, performance occurs, ie, when receipt or delivery of the goods or services is made. 

**Classification and measurement**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus or minus directly attributable transaction costs, except where the asset or liability is not measured at fair value through profit and loss. Fair value is taken as the transaction price, or otherwise determined by reference to quoted market prices or valuation techniques. 

Financial assets or financial liabilities in respect of assets acquired or disposed of through leasing arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy for leases described below. 

Financial assets so classified are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 

Financial liabilities so classified are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 

**133**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Page 16

**Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost** Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost are those held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and where cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. This includes cash equivalents, contract and other receivables, trade and other payables, rights and obligations under lease arrangements and loans receivable and payable. 

After initial recognition, these financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment \(for financial assets\). The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. 

Interest revenue or expense is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or amortised cost of a financial liability and recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and a financing income or expense. 

In the case of loans held from the Department of Health and Social Care, the effective interest rate is the nominal rate of interest charged on the loan. 

**Impairment of financial assets**

For all financial assets measured at amortised cost including lease receivables, contract receivables and contract assets or assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust recognises an allowance for expected credit losses. 

The Trust adopts the simplified approach to impairment for contract and other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, measuring expected losses as at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses. For other financial assets, the loss allowance is initially measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses \(stage 1\) and subsequently at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk assessed for the financial asset significantly increases \(stage 2\). 

At the end of the reporting period, the Trust assesses whether any financial assets, other than those held at ‘fair value through profit and loss’, require an allowance for an expected credit loss. Lifetime credit losses are recognised if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after initial recognition of the asset and that have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. However NHS bodies are not allowed to recognise any impairments against intra-DHSC

balances as it is expected that they will be recoverable, therefore no lifetime credit losses are made against NHS bodies. 

For financial assets that have become credit impaired since initial recognition \(stage 3\), expected credit losses at the reporting date are measured as the difference between the asset’s gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. 

Expected losses are charged to operating expenditure within the Statement of Comprehensive Income and reduce the net carrying value of the financial asset in the Statement of Financial Position. 

**De-recognition**

Financial assets are de-recognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Trust has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 

Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.

**Note 1.13 Leases**

A lease is a contract or part of a contract that conveys the right to use an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. An adaptation of the relevant accounting standard by HM Treasury for the public sector means that for NHS bodies, this includes lease-like arrangements with other public sector entities that do not take the legal form of a contract. It also includes peppercorn leases where consideration paid is nil or nominal \(significantly below market value\) but in al other respects meet the definition of a lease. The Trust does not apply lease accounting to new contracts for the use of intangible assets. 

The Trust determines the term of the lease with reference to the non-cancellable period and any options to extend or terminate the lease which the Trust is reasonably certain to exercise. 

**The Trust as a lessee**

*Recognition and initial measurement*

At the commencement date of the lease, being when the asset is made available for use, the Trust recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability. 

The right of use asset is recognised at cost comprising the lease liability, any lease payments made before or at commencement, any direct costs incurred by the lessee, less any cash lease incentives received. It also includes any estimate of costs to be incurred restoring the site or underlying asset on completion of the lease term. 

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease. Lease payments includes fixed lease payments, variable lease payments dependent on an index or rate and amounts payable under residual value guarantees. It also includes amounts payable for purchase options and termination penalties where these options are reasonably certain to be exercised. 

Where an implicit rate cannot be readily determined, the Trust’s incremental borrowing rate is applied. This rate is determined by HM Treasury annually for each calendar year. A nominal rate of 3.51% applied to new leases commencing in 2023 and 4.72% to new leases commencing in 2024. 

The Trust does not apply the above recognition requirements to leases with a term of 12 months or less or to leases where the value of the underlying asset is below £5,000, excluding any irrecoverable VAT. Lease payments associated with these leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term or other systematic basis. Irrecoverable VAT 

on lease payments is expensed as it fal s due. 

*Subsequent measurement*

As required by an HM Treasury interpretation of the accounting standard for the public sector, the Trust employs a revaluation model for subsequent measurement of right of use assets, unless the cost model is considered to be an appropriate proxy for current value in existing use or fair value, in line with the accounting policy for owned assets. The cost model is not considered to be an appropriate proxy for the value of the right of use asset in the following circumstances; 

where consideration exchanged is identified as significantly below market value; there are no terms that require lease payments to be updated for market conditions or there is a significant period between those updates in a longer- term lease; 

or if the fair value or current value in use could fluctuate significantly due to changes in market prices and conditions. 

The Trust subsequently measures the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount for interest arising which is also charged to expenditure as a finance cost and reducing the carrying amount for lease payments made. The liability is also remeasured for changes in assessments impacting the lease term, lease modifications or to reflect actual changes in lease payments. Such remeasurements are also reflected in the cost of the right of use asset. Where there is a change in the lease term or option to purchase the underlying asset, an updated discount rate is applied to the remaining lease payments. 

**135**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Page 18

**The Trust as a lessor**

The Trust assesses each of its leases and classifies them as either a finance lease or an operating lease. Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially al the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 

Where the Trust is an intermediate lessor, classification of the sublease is determined with reference to the right of use asset arising from the headlease. 

*Finance leases*

Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Trust’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is al ocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Trust’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases. 

*Operating leases*

Income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis or another systematic basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

**136**

**Annual report and accounts 2023-2024**

Page 19

**Note 1.14 Provisions **

The Trust recognises a provision where it has a present legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; for which it is probable that there wil be a future outflow of cash or other resources; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. The amount recognised in the Statement of Financial Position is the best estimate of the resources required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is significant, the estimated risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using HM Treasury's discount rates effective from 31 March 2024: **Nominal rate**

**Prior year rate**

Short-term

Up to 5 years

4.26%

3.27%

Medium-term

After 5 years up to 10 years

4.03%

3.20%

Long-term

After 10 years up to 40 years

4.72%

3.51%

Very long-term

Exceeding 40 years

4.40%

3.00%

HM Treasury provides discount rates for general provisions on a nominal rate basis. Expected future cash flows are therefore adjusted for the impact of inflation before discounting using nominal rates. The following inflation rates are set by HM Treasury, effective from 31 March 2024:

**Inflation rate**

**Prior year rate**

Year 1

3.60%

7.40%

Year 2

1.80%

0.60%

Into perpetuity

2.00%

2.00%

Early retirement provisions and injury benefit provisions both use the HM Treasury's post-employment benefits discount rate of 2.45% in real terms \(prior year: 1.70%\). 

**Clinical negligence costs**

NHS Resolution operates a risk pooling scheme under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution, which, in return, settles al clinical negligence claims. Although NHS Resolution is administratively responsible for al clinical negligence cases, the legal liability remains with the Trust. The total value of clinical negligence provisions carried by NHS Resolution on behalf of the Trust is disclosed at Note 25.1 but is not recognised in the Trust’s accounts. 

**Non-clinical risk pooling**

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust participates in the Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities to Third Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes, under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution and in return receives assistance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any excesses payable, in respect of particular claims are charged to operating expenses when the liability arises. 

**Note 1.15 Contingencies**

Contingent assets \(that is, assets arising from past events whose existence wil only be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within the entity’s control\) are not recognised as assets, but are disclosed in Note 26 where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. 

Contingent liabilities are not recognised, but are disclosed in Note 26, unless the probability of a transfer of economic benefits is remote. 

Contingent liabilities are defined as:

• possible obligations arising from past events whose existence wil be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity’s control; or

• present obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probable that a transfer of economic benefits wil arise or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

**Note 1.16 Public dividend capital**

Public dividend capital \(PDC\) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS organisation. HM Treasury has determined that PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. 

The Secretary of State can issue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the Trust. PDC is recorded at the value received. 

A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the Trust, is payable as public dividend capital dividend. The charge is calculated at the rate set by HM Treasury \(currently 3.5%\) on the average relevant net assets of the Trust during the financial year. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities, with certain additions and deductions as defined by the Department of Health and Social Care. 

This policy is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-financing-available-to-nhs-Trusts-and-foundation-Trusts. 

In accordance with the requirements laid down by the Department of Health and Social Care \(as the issuer of PDC\), the dividend for the year is calculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the “pre-audit” version of the annual accounts. The dividend calculated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result the audit of the annual accounts. 

**Note 1.17 Value added tax **

Most of the activities of Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust are outside the scope of VAT and, in general, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases is not recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of fixed assets. Where output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. 

**Note 1.18 Losses and special payments**

Losses and special payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to special control procedures compared with the generality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged to the relevant functional headings in expenditure on an accruals basis. 

The losses and special payments note is compiled directly from the losses and compensations register which reports on an accrual basis with the exception of provisions for future losses.

**Note 1.19 Early adoption of standards, amendments and interpretations** No new accounting standards or revisions to existing standards have been early adopted in 2023/24. 

**Note 1.20 Standards, amendments and interpretations in issue but not yet effective or adopted** The following standards have been issued but not yet adopted by DHSC

IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts - Not applicable to DHSC bodies as it is not UK endorsed IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts \(IFRS 17\) is being applied by HM Treasury in the Government Financial Reporting Manual \(FReM\) from 1 April 2025 \(with limited options for early adoption\) **Note 1.21 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies**

In the application of Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust’s accounting policies, management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from those estimates and the estimates, and underlying assumptions are continually reviewed. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 

In line with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust uses a provisions matrix approach. 

Within Financial Instruments the Trust has trade receivables and lease obligations. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust has had to estimate its irrecoverable debt value using the matrix for 2023/24, as disclosed in note 19.1. 

As part of the adoption of IFRS 16, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust reviewed al leases to determine whether a revaluation model or cost model would be used as a basis for valuing property leases. On review, it was determined that the property leases are subject to regular rent reviews throughout the lease term, based on the Retail Prices Index \(RPI\) and market conditions. As the rental values are regularly updated to account for market conditions, the Trust has applied the cost model when accounting for the property leases under IFRS16. 

IFRS 16 has been applied to al leases held by the Trust with a length of over 12 months and over £5k in value. 

**Note 1.22 Sources of estimation uncertainty**

The following are assumptions about the future and other major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year for Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust; 

*Property Valuation and Asset Lives*

Valuations have been undertaken by Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust's expert independant valuer, the District Valuer, part of the Valuation Agency Office, as at 31st March 2024. All operational assets have been valued on a current value in existing use basis. The land and building valuations are based on the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors valuation standards insofar as these are consistent with the requirements of HM Treasury and the Department of Health and Social Care. These valuations wil therefore be subject to changes in market conditions and market values. As part of this valuation the asset lives are also estimated by the District Valuer and are subject to professional judgement. 

Two properties, Otley and Horsforth, have been designated by the Trust as surplus assets, with no plan to bring them back into use and have been valued by the District Valuer at fair value. 

The Valuation Office Agency has valued the estate on the 31st March 2024 as £28,254k, with Land being £9,730k and Buildings £19,523k

2**Note 2 Operating Segments**

All activity at Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust is healthcare related and the majority of the Trust's revenue is received from within UK government departments. 

The main proportion of operating expenses are payroll related and are for the staff directly involved in the provision of healthcare, and the indirect and overhead costs associated with that provision. It is deemed that the business activities that earn revenues for the Trust, and in turn incur the expenses, are therefore one broad provision on which it is deemed appropriate to identify as only one segment, namely healthcare. 

Monthly operating results are published for assessment and review by the Trust's Chief Operating Decision Maker, which is the overall Trust Board that includes Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The financial position of the Trust to date, the Trust's Statement of Financial Position and Cash Flow and projections of future performance are assessed as a whole Trust rather than individual component parts that make up the sum total. In addition, all reporting of the position of the Trust is presented on a whole Trust basis that again implies a single operating segment under IFRS 8. 

As al decisions affecting the Trust's future direction and viability are made based on the overall total presented to Board, the Trust is satisfied that the single segment of healthcare is appropriate and consistent with the principles of IFRS 8.

\*\* Additional funding was made available by NHS England in 2023/24 and 2022/23 for implementing the backdated element of pay awards where government offers were made at the end of the financial year. 2023/24: In March 2024, the government announced a revised pay offer for consultants, reforming consultant pay scales with an effective date of 1 

March 2024. Trade Unions representing consultant doctors accepted the offer in April 2024. 2022/23: In March 2023, the government made a pay offer for staff on agenda for change terms and conditions which was later confirmed in May 2023. The additional pay for 2022/23 was based on individuals in employment at 31 March 2023. 

\*\*\*The employer contribution rate for NHS pensions increased from 14.3% to 20.6% \(excluding administration charge\) from 1 April 2019. Since 2019/20, NHS providers have continued to pay over contributions at the former rate with the additional amount being paid over by NHS England on providers' behalf. The full cost and related funding have been recognised in these accounts.

**Note 6 Operating leases - Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust as lessor** This note discloses income generated in operating lease agreements where Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust is the lessor. 

Leasing arrangements where the Trust is a lessor relate to the sub-letting of office accomodation, health centres and clinics, where the lessee is a GP practice or other healthcare organisation. 

Leasing arrangements are generally managed through a formal leasing process, with an ongoing review process. For some GP practices, where this is not in place, there are regular reviews of the GP commissioning arrangements with the ICB. 

Any vacant space is reviewed, to ensure there is no long term void space and short term arrangements may be made with 3rd parties.

**Note 10 Pension costs**

Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the NHS Pension Schemes. Details of the benefits payable and rules of the schemes can be found on the NHS Pensions website at www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions. Both the 1995/2008 and 2015 schemes are accounted for, and the scheme liability valued, as a single combined scheme. Both are unfunded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in England and Wales. They are not designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the NHS body of participating in each scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. 

In order that the defined benefit obligations recognised in the financial statements do not differ material y from those that would be determined at the reporting date by a formal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that “the period between formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years”. An outline of these follows: **a\) Accounting valuation**

A valuation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary \(currently the Government Actuary’s Department\) as at the end of the reporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period in conjunction with updated membership and financial data for the current reporting period, and is accepted as providing suitably robust figures for financial reporting purposes. The valuation of the scheme liability as at 31 March 2024, is based on valuation data as 31 March 2023, updated to 31 March 2024 with summary global member and accounting data. In undertaking this actuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed in IAS 19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. 

The latest assessment of the liabilities of the scheme is contained in the report of the scheme actuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Office. 

**b\) Full actuarial \(funding\) valuation**

The purpose of this valuation is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the schemes \(taking into account recent demographic experience\), and to recommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. 

The latest actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed as at 31 March 2020. The results of this valuation set the employer contribution rate payable from April 2024. The Department of Health and Social Care has recently laid Scheme Regulations confirming the employer contribution rate wil increase to 23.7% of pensionable pay from 1 April 2024 \(previously 20.6%\). The core cost cap cost of the scheme was calculated to be outside of the 3% cost cap corridor as at 31 March 2020. However, when the wider economic situation was taken into account through the economic cost cap cost of the scheme, the cost cap corridor was not similarly breached. As a result, there was no impact on the member benefit structure or contribution rates. 

**Other pension costs**

NEST \(National Employment Savings Trust\) is an alternative pension scheme set up to comply with new legislation which provides that employees fulfil ing certain criteria must auto-enrol into a pension scheme. When they do not qualify for or wish to join the NHS Pension Scheme this is Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust's mandatory alternative scheme. 

NEST Corporation is the Trustee body that has overall responsibility for running NEST. It is a non-departmental public body that operates at arm's length from government and is accountable to Parliament through the Department of Work and Pensions \(DWP\). 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust has incurred expenditure of £54k during the year in respect of contributions for employees under the NEST scheme.

**Note 16 Donations of property, plant and equipment** Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust received a £15k donation from the Leeds Community Heathcare charity towards the upgrade of the garden at Hannah House. 

**Note 17 Revaluations of property, plant and equipment**

Land and buildings are included in the Statement of Financial Position at their valuation on 31 March 2024. A comprehensive and full valuation was undertaken by the District Valuer part of the Valuation Office Agency, an independent RICS valuer, in accordance with RICS guidance. 

The valuation took into account improvements undertaken during the year as well as their current condition. The valuation methodology assumes that our buildings wil be maintained to their current condition over their remaining lives. 

The valuation was undertaken on a current value in existing use basis, as defined in DHSC GAM and reflecting the adaptation approved by Financial Reporting Advisory Board to IAS16. 

The impact of the valuation on land and property in full use is a net reduction in value of £1,307k. 

The useful lives applied to property, plant and equipment assets are shown in note 1.8. 

The properties at Otley and Horsforth have been identified by the Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust as surplus with no plan to bring them back into use. These have been measured by the District Valuer at fair value. The values from the District Valuer is £570k for Otley and £445k for Horsforth These properties are not currently classed as held for sale in the accounts and are within Property, Plant and Equipment. 

**Note 18 Leases - Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust as a lessee** This note details information about leases for which the Trust is a lessee. Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust has other short term leases in respect of property rental, vehicles and photocopiers.

**Note 19.2 Exposure to credit risk**

NHS debt is resolved through the agreement of balances process and, as such, is not considered to be a credit risk. In line with IFRS 9 Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust uses a provision matrix to categorise the debts and reviews historical losses over a two year period. The historical debt rates of non-NHS debt were determined by calculating invoices written off as a percentage of total non-NHS debt. 

Forward looking macro-economic factors were considered and the final credit losses rates were calculated. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust has a credit risk from ex-employee debt and the credit loss rate to be applied to this type of debt was calculated as 26.75%. For specific disputed debt, a credit risk of 100% 

has been applied and for any other outstanding debt over 6 months a credit risk has been applied at 50%. 

Overall a £132k credit loss al owance has been recognised for non-NHS receivables in 2023/24.

**Note 28 Financial instruments**

**Note 28.1 Financial risk management**

In accordance with IFRS 7, Trusts should disclose information that enables users of the accounts to evaluate the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the Trust is exposed at the end of the reporting period. 

Because of the continuing service provider relationship that Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust has with commissioners and the way those commissioners are financed, the Trust is not exposed to the degree of financial risk faced by business entities. In addition financial instruments play a much more limited role in creating or changing risk than would be typical of listed companies, to which the financial reporting standards mainly apply. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust has limited powers to borrow or invest surplus funds, and financial assets and liabilities are generated by day-to-day operational activities, rather than being held to change the risks facing the Trust in undertaking its activities. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust's treasury management operations are carried out by the finance department, within parameters defined formally within the Trust’s standing financial instructions and policies agreed by the Trust Board. The Trust's treasury activity is subject to review by the Trust's internal auditors. 

**Currency risk**

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust is principally a domestic organisation with the great majority of transactions, assets and liabilities being in the UK and sterling based. The Trust has no overseas operations. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust therefore has low exposure to currency rate fluctuations. 

**Interest rate risk**

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust has no borrowing in 2023/24. 

The Trust may borrow from government for capital expenditure, subject to affordability, as confirmed by NHS England. 

The borrowings would be for 1 – 25 years, in line with the life of the associated assets, and interest is charged at the National Loans Fund rate, fixed for the life of the loan. 

The Trust may also borrow from government for revenue financing subject to approval by NHS England. Interest rates are confirmed by the Department of Health and Social Care, the lender, at the point borrowing is undertaken. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust therefore has low exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 

**Credit risk**

The majority of Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust’s revenue comes from contracts with other public sector bodies, therefore, the Trust has low exposure to credit risk. The maximum exposures as at 31 March 2024 are in receivables from customers, as disclosed in note 19.2. 

**Liquidity risk**

The majority of Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust’s operating costs are incurred under contracts with Integrated Care Boards, which are financed from resources voted annually by Parliament. The Trust funds its capital expenditure from funds obtained within its prudential borrowing limit. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust is not therefore exposed to significant liquidity risks.

In line with the HM Treasury requirements, some previous accounts disclosures relating to staff costs are now required to be included in the staff report section of the annual report instead. The following tables link to data contained in the TAC and are included here for ease of formatting for the annual report. They should not be included in the annual accounts and these tables are not a complete list of numerical disclosures for the staff report.
