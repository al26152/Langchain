Labour Market Outlook *Summer 2025*

1 Foreword from the CIPD

The quarterly CIPD *Labour Market Outlook* \(LMO\) provides an early indication of future changes to the labour market around recruitment, redundancy and pay intentions. The findings are based on a survey of more than 2,000 employers. 

Business confidence remains at an unprecedented low, outside of the pandemic. Our net employment balance stands at \+9, little changed on the \+8 recorded last quarter. 

Hiring intentions among private sector firms also remain at a record low, outside of the pandemic. Just 57% of private sector employers plan to recruit staff in the next three months, down from 65% in autumn 2024. Policy changes from the government’s first year in office are reflected in our data. The increase in the rate of employer National Insurance and the lowering of the secondary threshold has had the same impact on costs as expected when they were first announced. These changes have disproportionately impacted lower-paying industries, and those hiring staff working fewer hours, due to the concurrent rise in the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage \(NMW/NLW\). 

Policy-makers should be particularly concerned about the impact on young people. 

While employers don’t pay National Insurance contributions \(NICs\) for workers under 21 or apprentices under 25, those who hire them were more likely to report that their employment costs have risen significantly. 

The public sector net employment balance remains below zero at −6. There has also been a fall in the proportion reporting hard-to-fill vacancies, coupled with a rise in those reporting no vacancies among public sector employers in the latest quarter. The government has outlined its plans for a leaner public sector. One example is the merger of NHS England and the Department for Health and Social Care, with NHS England currently subject to a recruitment freeze. There have also been announcements around digitalisation, defaulting communications regarding health through the NHS app, and embedding artificial intelligence \(AI\) as part of day-to-day working in the public sector. 

All factors point to reduced hiring plans. 

The government’s white paper  *Restoring control over the immigration system*, published in May, and the sudden enforcement of new rules in July to end overseas recruitment in social care, have had a marked impact on the sector. This quarter, the net employment balance in social care fell sharply from \+23 to −2. Other changes, including the raising of the skills and salary thresholds for workers from overseas, are likely to affect many employers. The complexity of the system has not been helped by the introduction of 1

a new and haphazardly put together temporary shortage list, which allows employers to continue to hire workers at the lower skills threshold. These 2

occupations are said to be based on the eight high-growth industries, identified in the new industrial strategy. While not an 3

exact mapping, employment intentions are positive in all these areas within our data. 

4

Overall, pay intentions remain at 3% for the year ahead, 5

unchanged over the past five quarters. This now sits below the latest inflation figure of 4.1%, if you include housing costs, as the 6

cost of living continues to play on employees’ minds.

redundancy outlook

The net employment balance – the difference between employers expecting there will be an increase in staff levels and those expecting there will be a decrease in staff levels in the next three months – has remained stable this quarter at \+9. This, however, remains an unprecedented low, having fallen to \+8 last quarter – the lowest figure on record apart from during the first year of the pandemic. 

Employer confidence remains low as businesses lick their wounds following a period of rising costs, including the tax rises which have come into effect from April. While news may have quietened around the ‘Trump tariffs’, the impact on UK exports to the US was evident, with a fall from £6.1bn in March 2025 to just £4.1bn in May 2025.1 

Employment intentions in the public sector remain below zero and have fallen from −4 last quarter to −6 this quarter. This means more employers in the public sector expect a decrease than an increase in staff levels over the next three months. 

Employment intentions remain stable in the private sector at \+12. Last quarter the net employment balance had fallen to \+11, a record low for the private sector \(outside of the early stages of the pandemic\) since we began collecting this measure in 2014.

As with last quarter, 25% of employers expect their staff levels to increase in the next three months. The proportion of surveyed employers expecting a decrease in staff levels is 16%, matching the figure from winter 2024/25. Roughly half \(53%\) of all employers believe their staff levels will be maintained in the next three months \(see Figure 2\).

The net employment balance is now below zero in several industries. It is lowest among public administration and other public sector employers \(−12\). There is a negative net employment balance in both education categories. It is −8 among employers in compulsory education, which includes primary and secondary education, and −4 among non-compulsory education, which includes vocational and higher education institutions. The government’s initial announcement,2 and subsequent enforcement, of ending overseas recruitment for social care has had a marked impact on the net employment balance in this industry, which has fallen from \+23 last quarter to −2 this quarter. 

At the same time, the government has set out its priorities for growth as part of its industrial strategy.3 As part of this it has identified eight high-growth industries. While not an exact mapping, employment intentions are positive in all these areas.

Base: summer 2025, all employers \(total: n=2,018; private: n=1,500; public: n=326; voluntary: n=192\). 

Employer costs

In our winter 2024/25 LMO report, we highlighted the potential impact of the National Insurance changes and the usual increases in the minimum wage on employment costs. In that report we found almost nine in 10 employers believed their employment costs would increase because of the increase in the employer rate of NICs \(89%\) and the reduction in the ‘secondary threshold’ \(87%\). 

This quarter we find that has largely borne true, with 84% reporting their employment costs have increased due to changes to National Insurance contributions in April 2025. However, the changes may not have been as severe as 1

first thought. Prior to the changes coming to effect, around four in ten believed their employment costs would increase to a large extent because of the increase in the 2

employer rate of NICs \(43%\) and the reduction in the ‘secondary threshold’ \(40%\). Due to the changes, only 32% now say their employment costs have increased to a large 3

extent – less than had originally anticipated significant increases. 

4

Despite this, there are some industries that have been hit hard by these increased costs. Half of employers in care and hospitality report that their employment costs 5

have increased to a large extent due to these changes. 

6

In all industries except IT, other professional services, and arts and recreation, at least 60% of employers report that National Insurance changes have increased their 7

employment costs to some extent.

Alarmingly, these changes have had a disproportionate impact on firms that hire young people. Hospitality, for example, has the largest number of workers under 21. 

3

We find that 37% of employers who hire young people, aged under 21, have said the National Insurance changes have increased their employment costs to a large 4

extent. This compares with 23% of employers who do not hire young people. While employees under the age of 21 are exempt from employer National Insurance, in 5

times of a weakening economy and with strong cost pressures, employers are less likely to take younger staff on. Periods of unemployment for young people are 6

‘scarring’. It leads to lower earnings potential and the increased likelihood of further 7

spells of unemployment. It is also associated with negative mental health and 8

wellbeing outcomes. The latest data on payrolled employees from PAYE real-time information4 shows that between October 2024 \(when the changes were announced\) and May 2025, payrolled employees fell by 5.1% among 16- to 17-year-olds and 1.1% 

among 18- to 24-year-olds. This compares with an overall contraction of 0.5%.

When asking employers about which cost increase has had the largest financial impact on their business in the last 12 months, the rise in employer NICs leads the way \(see Figure 9\). Thirty-six per cent of employers report this as their biggest cost increase over the past year. With the exception of hospitality, all industries report the NICs rise as having the largest financial impact on their business in the past year \(see Appendix\). 

Another cost pressure faced by many businesses is rising energy costs, with 15% of employers reporting this as having the largest financial impact on their business. 

Twelve per cent of organisations reported that the rise in the National Minimum/

Living Wage \(NMW/NLW\) has had the biggest financial impact on their business in the last 12 months. Businesses in hospitality were split between this and the NICs rise as being the largest cost increase \(27% and 26% respectively\) \(see Figure 10\). Employers in construction \(21%\) and retail \(19%\) reported the NMW/NLW rise as the cost increase 1

with the biggest financial impact at a rate higher than the average employer.

4 Job vacancies

The labour market continues to cool, with official data published in mid-July showing that overall vacancy levels have fallen each month for the past three years.5 

We find that the rate of employers reporting hard-to-fill vacancies has also fallen over much of that period \(see Table 1\). Thirty-one per cent of employers reported hard-to-fill vacancies in the latest quarter.

The level of public sector employers currently reporting hard-to-fill vacancies has fallen significantly from 44% last quarter to 34% this quarter. This is in part due to 2

the proportion of employers reporting no vacancies rising. Half \(49%\) of public sector employers currently have no vacancies or are unsure if their organisation has 3

vacancies, up from 40% last quarter.

Figure 12 shows the proportion of employers reporting hard-to-fill vacancies has fallen and the proportion reporting no vacancies has risen in all public sector-related industries since last quarter. In the public administration and other public sector categories, 27% of employers reported hard-to-fill vacancies. This is down from 39% last quarter. Similarly, compulsory education has gone from 49% to 42% 

of employers reporting hard-to-fill vacancies. In healthcare, half \(51%\) of employers report no vacancies, up from 45% last quarter. As of writing, NHS England is currently advertising no vacancies due to the merger with the Department for Health and Social Care \(DHSC\).

Recruitment pressures are still expected to remain in healthcare, social care, and transport and storage. Recent changes to immigration rules brought into force in July are likely to exacerbate this in the short run, especially in industries more dependent on migrant labour. Changes include closing the Social Care Worker visa route for new overseas applicants. The skills threshold for Skilled Worker visas has also risen to RQF level 6 

\(graduate level\), removing 111 previously eligible RQF 3–5 occupations across all sectors.

Pay outlook

5

Among employers looking to increase, decrease or freeze pay in the next 12 months, the median expected basic pay increase for the next 12 months remains at 3% overall, for the fifth consecutive quarter. Expected pay awards held at a historic high of 5% 

between winter 2022/23 and autumn 2023, before falling to 4% in winter 2023/24 and spring 2024. 

The median expected pay award remains at 3% in the private and public sectors. It has fallen in the voluntary sector from 3% last quarter to 2.5% this quarter. To put the median expected pay awards into context, the Consumer Prices Index \(CPIH\), the Office for National Statistics’ \(ONS\) preferred measure of inflation, currently stands at 4.1%. 

In terms of the distribution, the lower quartile is estimated to be 2%, with the upper quartile at 4%, with the latter value falling from 5% last quarter. 

It should be noted that the average basic pay award covered in this analysis is only one component of pay growth. Many people will also benefit from incremental progression or promotion, bonuses or a pay bump when switching jobs.

Recommendations for 

6 employers and people 

practitioners

 Keep workloads manageable amid reduced recruitment With most employers planning to hold staffing levels steady, unfilled roles can increase strain on existing teams. Monitor workloads regularly and ensure staff have the resources and support they need to stay productive, engaged and well. 

 Invest in young people as a long-term workforce strategy With youth employment falling, it’s vital to maintain access routes for young workers. 

Offer mentoring, clear development pathways, and early-career support to build your future talent pipeline. 

 Strengthen recruitment strategies to overcome hard-to-fill roles Review your employee value proposition and adopt inclusive hiring practices – 

such as simplifying job requirements, widening outreach and offering flexibility – to access a broader talent pool and improve the chances of successful recruitment. 

 Review your workforce plans in light of immigration changes

New visa rules introduced in July 2025 have restricted access to many mid- and lower-skilled roles for overseas workers, including the closure of the Social Care Worker route. Assess how this affects your hiring plans and explore alternative sourcing strategies. 

 Retain key talent through skills and career development In a cooling labour market, supporting progression can improve retention and reduce pressure to recruit externally. Provide opportunities for reskilling, upskilling and 

internal mobility to help employees grow with your organisation.
