**Context**

**Starting well**

This Health and Wellbeing Strategy is a blueprint for enabling people to live fulfilling lives in a healthy city, supported by high quality equitable services. It is led by the Leeds Health and Wellbeing Board, but it belongs to everyone. Everyone in Leeds has a role to play in creating a city which does the very best for its people.

**How will we know we are **

**The life course approach**

**making a difference? **

This Health and Wellbeing Strategy will be 

focused on improving outcomes and reducing 

inequalities at each stage of a person’s life, to 

ensure everyone has the best start in life, can live well, work well, age well and be supported at the 

end of life. 

We have identified five clear outcomes which will 

demonstrate the difference made in improving 

people’s health and wellbeing:

1. People will live longer and have 

happier, healthier lives. 

2. People will live full, active and 

independent lives. 

3. People’s quality of life will improve with 

access to quality services.
