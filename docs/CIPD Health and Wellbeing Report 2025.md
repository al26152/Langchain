This report highlights the views of employees on health and wellbeing using data from our CIPD *Good Work Index 2025* report. This report is based on data from 5,017 UK workers \(unweighted figure\), collected in January and February 2025. The figures are weighted and representative of UK working adults.

Health and wellbeing at work 2025: Views of employees 1 How employees feel about 

their physical and mental 

health 

Most staff say that they are positive about their mental and physical health in 2025, with around two-thirds saying that it is good or very good \(Figure 1\). 

However, a sizeable minority say that they would describe their health as poor, while around one in five employees feel neither one way nor the other.

2 How employees feel 

at work

Most employees report regularly feeling enthusiasm, immersion and a sense of time flying at work, although comparatively fewer employees report feeling full of energy. When it comes to negative feelings such as loneliness and boredom, the number of employees reporting these feelings is much lower, 1

but a significant minority of staff do say that they regularly feel exhausted or under excessive pressure at work \(Figure 2\). Feeling exhausted or under 2

excessive pressure should be concerning for employers as these factors can lead to stress, potentially raising the risk for negative employee outcomes. 

3

Feeling negative about work could also increase the risk of employees feeling 4

less engaged in the work they’re carrying out. The extent to which people are engaged at work should also be an important focus for employers, 5

as it is important for job quality and can have an influence on team and organisational performance. Tackling this at an earlier stage by improving how 6

positively or negatively workers feel could help reduce the risk of a drop in engagement down the line.

3 Impact of work on 

physical and mental health

Looking at how employees perceive that work impacts their mental and physical health, there are some worrying findings. A quarter feel that work has 1

a negative effect on both their mental and physical health \(Figure 3\). These findings should sound a loud warning bell for employers, as this equates 2

to around 8 million employees in the UK labour force who feel that work is 3

having a debilitating impact on their health. 

When looking at how work intersects with mental health, our research finds 4

that less than half of staff feel that work impacts their mental health positively, while just a third perceive a positive effect on their physical health. This 5

demonstrates the need for employers to look at ways to not only ensure that work isn’t negatively impacting employees’ mental or physical health, but also 6

a need to determine how work can be used to have a positive impact.

Drivers and outcomes of 

4 poor physical and mental 

health 

When looking at what could explain drivers of poor physical and mental health, our research identified a number of correlating workplace factors. 

Notably, high workloads, being put under excessive pressure, exhaustion, poor relationships with colleagues and poor perceptions of line managers are all associated with a greater feeling that work affects health negatively \(Figure 4\).

Drivers and outcomes of poor physical and mental health 

Health and wellbeing at work 2025: Views of employees Health and wellbeing at work 2025: Views of employees Regarding outcomes, a compelling rationale for ensuring work positively impacts people’s mental health is the negative consequences that can be seen when this is not prioritised, both for individual staff and the organisation more widely. In particular, our findings \(Figure 5\) show that when staff feel their work impacts their mental health negatively, they report: 

• lower levels of satisfaction in their role

• a greater likelihood of quitting

• a lower likelihood of recommending their employer or going above and beyond to benefit the organisation

• lower levels of innovation in their role.

How employees feel about 

5 their workplace climate for 

wellbeing

1

Wellbeing can be a key area organisations focus on and invest in; however, 2

our research found that staff report mixed feelings about the climate for wellbeing in their workplace. Just over half feel that their organisation is 3

supportive of people’s mental health and facilitates open conversations about mental health issues. 

4

Nevertheless, this unfortunately still leaves a sizeable proportion of employees 5

who feel underserved in this regard \(Figure 6\). Staff are more positive around the role of line managers in fostering a working environment that supports 6

people’s mental health, with over two-thirds feeling that their manager is open and approachable on such issues.

6 The impact of work on 

health conditions

The number of employees who say they are experiencing a health issue is high, with over two-thirds of staff reporting that they have experienced a health condition in the last 12 months, with backache or other bone, joint or muscle problems, sleep issues and anxiety being the most common \(Figure 7\).

The impact of work on health conditions

Health and wellbeing at work 2025: Views of employees Health and wellbeing at work 2025: Views of employees The majority of conditions are perceived to be relatively unrelated to work. 

However, some health conditions, such as repetitive strain injury \(RSI\) and injuries due to work accidents, are unsurprisingly felt to be strongly influenced by work. It’s concerning that mental health issues like anxiety and depression are also felt to be influenced by work by a large proportion of employees \(Figure 8\). 

This raises the question of whether employers could do more to ensure that the work being done by employees isn’t negatively impacting their mental health or ensure that steps are taken to mitigate stress levels, or workload that could have a negative impact on mental health.

The impact of work on health conditions

Health and wellbeing at work 2025: Views of employees 7 How working from home 

correlates with mental and 

physical health 

Our research highlights some interesting differences when looking at the correlation between working in different locations and health, showing that a level of hybrid working is most beneficial \(Figure 9\). Notably, hybrid working correlates significantly more strongly with positive perceptions of mental health \(66% rate their mental health as good\), compared with those with no availability of homeworking \(59%\).

As for physical health, while there is only a minor difference between no homeworking and hybrid working, access to hybrid working is significantly more strongly correlated with good physical health, compared with only working from home \(Figure 10\).
