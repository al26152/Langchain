00:17:58.000 Morning everyone. Um, well done for braving the rain. Um, so good morning. So my name is Richard
00:18:04.640 Stubs. I am honored and delighted to be standing here today on behalf of all
00:18:10.000 four Northern Health Innovation Networks. So, not only from myself and
00:18:15.200 my chair Chris at Health Innovation York and Humber, but also from Phil and Louise at Health Innovation Northwest
00:18:20.880 Coast, Ben and Mark at Health Innovation Manchester, and Nicola and Dean at Health Innovation Northeast and North
00:18:27.120 Cumbria. Welcome to Leeds, welcome to Yorkshire, and most importantly, welcome to Health Innovation North. Um, last
00:18:34.240 year we were in Liverpool and I know that those of you who were there would agree it was a fabulous event and we
00:18:42.400 weren't certain that we could top that. But looking at the simply stellar lineup
00:18:47.760 of speakers and panelists today, um, we actually all think that we have. Um now
00:18:53.360 in the traditional way u we'll save our thanks for pulling this event together till the end but I just did want to say
00:18:59.280 at the top just a really particular thank you to Helen Williams at Health Innovation Northwest Coast and also to
00:19:04.880 Kathy Scott at York and Humber for leading the planning of today's event. So thank you guys and also well done to
00:19:11.440 you for getting a ticket um for those who are here in person because this is massively oversubscribed and most of the
00:19:18.000 tickets were snapped up within a few weeks of being advertised. So, thank you for not reselling your sort after ticket
00:19:24.320 on any online reselling website. And if you actually are here because you spent an extraordinary amount on a tout for um
00:19:31.679 a ticket, then I actually still think you'll find it's money well spent. So, so strap in. Um and welcome to those of
00:19:37.679 you joining us on the live stream. We'll be broadcasting a live feed of our presentations and our panel sessions
00:19:43.360 throughout the day on YouTube. Now, quickly on the housekeeping, no planned fire alarms. Um the fire exit in this
00:19:50.559 room is over here to my left to your right and the fire point should we need it is at the back of the building next
00:19:56.799 to Aspire. So why health innovation
00:20:02.240 north? Um simply because as those of us who live and work here already know our
00:20:07.679 region is an absolute powerhouse of industry innovation and healthcare. Our
00:20:13.039 northern economy in England is worth more than 340 billion pounds which is greater than uh Austria and Norway
00:20:20.000 combined. We also now have more devolved power in the north than elsewhere in the
00:20:25.280 country. Nine combined authority may out of a current total of 14 across England.
00:20:31.039 As health innovation networks who deliver local change for national impact, devolution has become a
00:20:36.799 substantial opportunity for us to influence and champion the life the local growth plans of our respective
00:20:43.200 places. Um ensuring that health and life sciences are at the core of our mayoral priorities. And as an example, here in
00:20:50.640 West Yorkshire, we've just launched our new Propel Health Tech program that's doubled in size and ambition,4.5
00:20:57.919 million pounds worth of funding from the West Yorkshire Mayor's Investment Zone. That means that over the next next four
00:21:04.240 years, we're going to support 240 businesses, helping them to scale up in the NHS, contribute to our regional
00:21:10.480 economic growth, bring jobs, and develop life-changing innovations for patients.
00:21:15.600 And as always, there's so much to celebrate. So if you stay just here in York for a minute, we should also note
00:21:21.120 the fact that the MH has chosen LED as its location for its new digital hub.
00:21:26.480 That's an investment that will help to attract top talent, boost regional partnerships, accelerate the pipeline of
00:21:31.840 innovation from lab to patient. And also LE has been named as one of the three new thematic campuses leading
00:21:37.679 government's health mission that places local communities and frontline workers at the heart of policy development.
00:21:44.080 Across the penines in Greater Manchester, there are strategic alliance alliances between healthcare and
00:21:49.200 industry that are addressing major population health challenges with a particular focus on reaching into
00:21:55.120 underserved communities to address inequalities. And their health innovation accelerator program is a
00:22:00.880 beacon of that approach, leveraging around 30 million pounds worth of public and private funding over three years.
00:22:06.320 And actually just this morning, medical products and technology firm uh Convertitech has announced a 500 pound
00:22:13.039 uh 500 million pound investment for a new flagship research and development site in Manchester.
00:22:19.280 Staying over the penines in the northwest coast, there are really ambitious plans to establish a national center for health and care robotics
00:22:26.320 using the principles of the living lab which will harness expertise and technologies from a range of sectors.
00:22:32.640 And further north, over the last 12 months, Health Innovation Northeast and North Cumbri have secured two and a half
00:22:38.080 million pounds in partnership deals with industry focused on population health priorities, including cardiovascular
00:22:43.440 disease prevention and chronic kidney disease. They assess their new ideas using their innovation pathway, which is
00:22:49.520 now integrated into their ICB governance processes. Hello, Sam. to accelerate decision- making relating to new
00:22:55.039 opportunities as a network. We've just published our latest health uh uh national impact
00:23:02.559 report which details how over the last year as a national network we have
00:23:07.600 delivered national programs that benefited well over a million patients. We've created or safeguarded over 900
00:23:13.760 jobs in the UK. We've created wealth by leveraging almost 500 million pounds
00:23:19.200 worth of investment through our support to our innovators which when you actually track back to 2018 that's over3
00:23:26.000 billion pounds worth of investment leveraged through our supporters health innovation networks but there is a lot
00:23:31.760 more on the table to go after and we are really ambitious to do more. Our recently published health innovation
00:23:38.000 network report defining the size of the health innovation prize showed that innovations in health care could boost
00:23:44.720 the UK's growth by bringing in around 246 billion pounds every year to our
00:23:49.840 GDP. It calculated that the economic value of reducing ill health through
00:23:55.039 innovation is an equivalent of 9.6% of the entire British economy and that's
00:24:01.360 exactly what health innovation networks were set up to deliver. So today is all about collaborating. We
00:24:07.760 do need to think collectively and constructively challenge each other to do things differently in the way that we
00:24:13.520 deliver our healthcare. The 10-year plan and the life science sector plan give us clear signals of the government's
00:24:20.640 priorities for health and growth. Now we are here to do more at scale to achieve those ambitions, but we can't do it
00:24:27.440 without your help and partnership. So I really hope you enjoy the day. And to kick us off, I'm delighted to welcome
00:24:33.919 one of our sponsors, Anna Race, director of health system engagement and partnerships at Bowinger England. Anna,
00:24:40.930 [Applause]
00:24:47.919 thanks for that. I thought I was going to have to shout for a moment then. Thank you, Richard. Um, so good morning everyone. I'm Anna
00:24:53.840 Reece. Um, and as Richard said, I have a role on behalf of Buring Engleheim called director of health system
00:24:59.600 engagement and partnerships. And I too would like to welcome everybody to our second I think it is uh health
00:25:06.960 innovation north annual conference. It's ever growing very much so. It's great to see so many colleagues here from across
00:25:13.440 academia, from across the life science sector and equally from across the systems. And on behalf of Buring
00:25:19.840 Ringleheim and probably on behalf of all of us, um we would really like to extend our thanks to the health innovation
00:25:25.360 north team for having the opportunity to be able to bring us all together
00:25:30.400 at Buringer. We very much believe that health innovation matters most when it truly reaches patients and also
00:25:37.919 communities. And so for us, sponsoring today isn't just about having our logo on the agenda, our name on the slides.
00:25:46.480 It's very much about being able to show up as a partner and one that listens first, one that is able to stand
00:25:52.320 shoulderto-shoulder with you to be able to help face the challenges that you have.
00:25:57.679 The life sciences sector is a critical part of the UK's industrial strategy and equally its health strategy. And our
00:26:03.760 collective role is not just to be able to produce medicines and also technologies. It's very much around
00:26:10.320 making sure that we're able to help create the conditions where in uh where innovation can really thrive where
00:26:16.400 adoption is faster and where access is fairer and the benefits are felt across
00:26:22.159 entire populations. And that is going to take collaboration. collaboration between national strategy
00:26:28.799 and communities, collaboration between NHS leaders and the life sciences industry and collaboration between
00:26:34.880 industry and academia. So for us being a partner means finding
00:26:40.080 joint alignment. It means finding a common goal, something that we can build
00:26:45.120 together around and also hold each other accountable to and deliver against. It's
00:26:50.159 about us bringing our evidence, our insights, our skills, our capabilities and expertise to the table along with
00:26:56.880 the whole might of our organizations. It's about sharing the benefit and risk
00:27:01.919 of innovation so that we can scale and we can be sustainable for the future.
00:27:07.039 And finally, it's also about understanding that it's not always easy. In fact, it's plumbing complicated.
00:27:15.120 So as you go through today's sessions, as Richard said, um I really do encourage you to think about what partnership really can mean and what it
00:27:21.919 can look like in practice, not just in theory, and how we can move beyond transactions towards a collaboration
00:27:28.400 that really does create change. So thank you again um and equally to the Health Innovation Network for convening us
00:27:34.880 together and we really do wish you a productive and inspiring conference.
00:27:40.080 Thank you. Uh thanks very much. Now with no further
00:27:45.840 ado and with huge thanks for taking the time out to join us today, please uh introduce our first keynote address,
00:27:52.880 chief executive of NHS England, Sir James Mackey. [Applause]
00:28:01.840 Thanks, Richard. And it's it's good to be here today. I'm I want I I'll start by just explaining a little bit about
00:28:08.159 where where we've been this year and where we are. We're we're clearly at a quite a um chunky crossroads at this
00:28:15.919 point in the year with an awful lot going on. Uh having published the 10-year plan, spending review, that
00:28:21.919 messy moment mid year where it's starting to feel a bit tricky, the politics is a bit awkward, etc. But a
00:28:27.520 good reminder today that the we'll only get through this long term by being able
00:28:33.440 to innovate, by making innovation actually count, bringing it to the front line, changing how we're delivering
00:28:39.120 services, etc. So just very very briefly as a reminder when we started the year
00:28:46.240 we had nearly a 7 billion pound problem after deficit support 4.5 billion pound
00:28:51.919 problem that's being rapidly forgotten now as we kind of get in the air and everybody's in the bullets but also um
00:28:59.520 as well as that really big problems with performance and the big problem that we all we all have which I'll come back to
00:29:06.399 later on is that growing disconnect between us and the population British social latitude survey. There's people
00:29:12.080 get grumpy about that when I talk about it, but there's whichever way you look at the public view of the NHS, it's not
00:29:18.640 where we need it to be. And some of that's about access. Quite a lot of it's
00:29:24.000 about you're making me use a service that doesn't feel like the way I live the rest of me life. It's still very
00:29:30.960 old-fashioned. It's very clunky. It's very personal. I've got to travel for
00:29:36.080 things that are live the rest of me life very remotely, very digitally, very interactively, etc. But throughout all
00:29:44.240 of that, that all that noise in the spring, the first thing we needed really was the NHS leadership community to step
00:29:50.000 up, say, we're taking this seriously, try and settle the markets down, you know, etc., etc., and give confidence
00:29:55.600 that we're going to we're going to at least have a right go. And I think, you know, I think that's really evident in
00:30:01.360 everything that we've seen so far. It does feel a bit overwhelming at times. So said in an internal thing last week,
00:30:08.880 probably if you're in the health core health service, if you're running a trust or an ICB or you know whatever
00:30:15.120 you're doing, if you're not feeling overwhelmed, there's probably something wrong with you, right? It's really
00:30:21.679 really hard at the minute to just try and stay focused at the right uh on the right things. this last few weeks.
00:30:28.240 September is always awful in the national system and this this year has exceeded all expectations of awfulness
00:30:35.360 as is everything's coming together and then and the big focus on how do we get through this next six months but also
00:30:42.320 build some foundations for the future which again from your perspective is a really a really big important part as
00:30:50.000 Richard's already pointed out the often the discussion about the NHS is about the NHS being a cost being a burden
00:30:58.080 on society. Can we afford it? You know, etc. It's a growth driver, right? So,
00:31:03.919 you all know that you're involved in all of this. If we get lost in that narrative about the NHS as a cost, we
00:31:11.039 should all go home, right? We all know, especially in the north, we are massive
00:31:17.200 employers, the main employer. We are the main supply chain. We are the thing that
00:31:23.039 can drive the economy. So again, in all this stuff that's going on around the economy and the worries about fragility
00:31:28.960 and all that, we can be the way out of it, but we've got to shift the perception away from you spend money in
00:31:35.279 health, it's just a cost. It's a dead weight, you know, etc. and thinking more about our about our growth opportunity.
00:31:42.720 And in the 10-year plan, I think did a really good job at setting out reasonable ambition. We're trying to
00:31:48.159 turn that into what's manageable next year and the year after and the year after that when we've got so many cost
00:31:54.000 pressures and other things, but also that ability of the NHS to digest stuff
00:32:00.000 and execute stuff in a in a reasonable way in a way that then has has an improvement on experience of the patient
00:32:07.760 but also makes our staff's lives easier, more productive, uh better place to
00:32:13.279 work, um etc. Uh so we're absolutely sticking to all the plan and all the all
00:32:18.880 the things that were said in it. We're in that now. How how does this how does this all work? Where we're going to make
00:32:24.240 most impact next year and the year after which I'll come I'll come to again in a
00:32:30.320 minute. We're in the middle of that arm wrestling process now about trying to get medium-term planning instructions
00:32:37.200 out in the next uh the next couple of weeks. Still everyone will be aware we're having discussions with Treasury
00:32:43.039 about how all that works. Well, that'll be the first time in my memory, I can't remember when we last did medium-term
00:32:49.279 planning, which I think gives you all a chance to start thinking about how do we
00:32:54.480 start phasing these things over over time. Everything doesn't happen have to happen next June. There's a way of
00:33:00.880 building medium-term plans, working together, getting alignment, thinking about sequencing and uh bringing these
00:33:07.600 things to life over the next uh this next few years as as we do that. Um,
00:33:12.960 when we talk about innovation, I'm always slightly nervous talking to an audience about innovation because
00:33:18.080 depending on who you're talking to, it means different people. They're different things to different people.
00:33:23.519 So, let's not get all too caught up on a my version of innovation is technology or it's service transformation or it's
00:33:32.000 health tech or it's new drugs and devices or it's all of those things. And frankly, when we're trying to
00:33:38.080 prioritize, we need innovation across all of that. We we need it everywhere as
00:33:44.240 quickly as we can. Come back to that point earlier on. As NHS leaders, we're going to try and make this digestible
00:33:50.240 and executable and prioritize is appropriate, etc. And wherever you go,
00:33:56.159 um, you will see fantastic innovation when whether you're at a national
00:34:01.440 conference and or you're in a trust. Often even if you're in a trust with lots of problems, there'll be fantastic
00:34:08.320 innovations going on out there. But we don't leverage it properly, we don't harness it properly, we don't sell it
00:34:14.079 properly. And one of the big striking things for me when I went into uh Newcastle Hospitals, I had a tricky
00:34:19.440 time. You know, the place was getting battered a bit with CQC problems and financial problems and all that. To find
00:34:25.839 that there was a service that was 100 meters from my office for a disease that was invented in Newcastle and is only
00:34:33.280 treated in Newcastle in the UK and is one of only, I think, four places in the world can offer that treatment. Was
00:34:40.399 really sobering for me to think in all this noise, we have got wonderful things
00:34:45.520 going on, but we're not we're not selling it properly. We're not leveraging it properly. We're not giving
00:34:51.440 our staff the credit for it. And certainly the population often aren't aware of of of all of that which so
00:34:58.240 we've got to bring that more to life. So first of all at play in all this, let's not get not get all too stroppy about
00:35:04.160 which bit of innovation you're interested in because it's all of it that uh that counts.
00:35:11.040 The year so far has been strong so far on uh financial performance. As I've
00:35:17.680 said, as we're going to the half year point, you can feel the wheels wobbling now. We'll have a few pop out problems
00:35:23.680 this month. Um we'll get on top of that. We'll have a few more pop out at quarter three and then hopefully we'll land a
00:35:29.359 year where we need to land. We started well operationally. Industrial Action made that wobble a little bit. As a
00:35:36.560 reminder, what industrial action does as well as that terrible disruption that goes on and the the potential scarring
00:35:44.000 we've got in the future of people having disputes with each other and all that is it really brings to life how reliant we
00:35:52.400 are for a service model that was built for 1948. It's not built for today.
00:35:59.119 Right? So we are relying on lots of things that technology can replace, clinical models can replace. we can be
00:36:05.839 organized in different fashion etc. So really good reminder there and we had a
00:36:11.280 bit of a we've had a bit of a wobble since then which we'll get back on uh track our really really big problem
00:36:18.400 we've got to deal with and the 10-year workforce plan will have to uh start
00:36:23.520 dealing with this uh properly is regardless of what everybody thinks
00:36:29.359 which is generally the NHS hasn't got enough people and our colleagues feel like they haven't got enough people
00:36:35.599 we've had a huge growth in people. And we've actually in the last five years
00:36:41.359 have become more old-fashioned in our model because we've become more humanorientated,
00:36:47.599 more people dependent in terms of the way the services are provided when the rest of the economy and the rest of the
00:36:54.000 world has become more technology orientated and less people orientated. It's a really big challenge for us. 21%
00:37:01.599 uh growth in workforce and a small increase 8% growth in volume. That's
00:37:09.119 what we mean by productivity, right? So there's a load of intellectual ways of describing productivity. We've grown
00:37:15.680 massively further in cost and people than we have in terms of output. And
00:37:21.760 we've got to, you know, we've got all the backlogs that people understand and the worries about access. So that we've got to unlock unlock that uh somehow.
00:37:30.960 So, we've made quite a good start from a rocky rocky position. We're at that kind
00:37:36.320 of midyear midyear point now where you can feel the tension of it all starting to you know wobble and worry about how
00:37:42.000 we're going to cut through on ICB changes NHS England DHSSE changes um
00:37:48.960 delivering winter delivering on our operational and financial imperatives but also really importantly making a
00:37:55.760 start on the 10-year plan in that all of my last two months on the 10-year plan
00:38:01.760 has been about that looks lovely what's the impact What is this going to do? It's all right
00:38:07.920 saying we're going to do neighborhood health. What's it actually going to do for patients? If we can't describe that,
00:38:14.000 we need to shift and talk about something else that's going to have an impact on patients. So, in your work,
00:38:21.440 there's loads of fantastic things going on that you're all doing today and have planned to do. If it can't bring to life
00:38:29.760 what we mean about the shifts, about shifting care outside of hospital, about making things more technology
00:38:36.640 orientated, about getting us out of a 1948 model, frankly, making a big impact
00:38:42.320 on outpatients, making a big impact on urgent care pathways, making a big impact on staff
00:38:49.200 and patient satisfaction. Think about what you're doing because we all need to
00:38:54.400 get behind the key the key priorities. the clock's ticking really really rapidly. So really in in all that you're
00:39:01.440 doing all great stuff, think about impact. Think about how you measure impact. Think about how we scale.
00:39:07.680 Because the other thing we've got that we're grappling with now is on nearly every problem we have to solve, there is
00:39:14.320 someone in the NHS has solved it, is already smashing it out of the park. But
00:39:19.839 often even in a hospital it's one ward and the ward next door hasn't or a
00:39:26.000 hospital hasn't and the one next door hasn't or a set of community services has and the one next door hasn't or a
00:39:32.160 PCN has and the one one next door hasn't. That's our enemy. So we say international service feels very
00:39:38.079 fragmented and we've got to find ways of bringing these things to life in a more systematic and rapid uh rapid uh way.
00:39:46.640 So, I'm going to stop. We'll take some questions. You can ask whatever you want. As always, be a bit careful like
00:39:52.400 on social media and stuff so I don't get into too much trouble. Really do appreciate what you're doing. When when
00:39:58.079 I was just sitting there watching Richard talk when I do when I talk about innovation, the thing that always comes
00:40:04.000 to mind about 15 years ago, I spoke at a conference in Gway. Has anyone been to Gway before? Fantastic place. Don't ever
00:40:10.160 drink with the Irish. the uh and the um really tight community, big health tech
00:40:16.640 community, everyone's connected obviously in Ireland, everybody knows each other. It felt like when the
00:40:22.320 cardiologist spoke about what he really needed, somebody was going to run out
00:40:27.359 the door into their factory, make a device, bring it back to him so he could
00:40:34.160 take it back to work and use it. That's where I think the North can be. We have the ability. We've got the raw
00:40:40.160 ingredients. who've got your skills, expertise and enthusiasm will need to harness it.
00:40:49.839 Thank you. Um Jim, that's fantastic. Thank you so
00:40:55.520 much and thank you for agreeing to some questions. We do have some time. So this is a fantastic opportunity for us. Please, we have a robing mic. Um so can
00:41:03.119 I see some hands, please? And while we wait for a sleepy audience,
00:41:09.599 Jim, can I ask you a question about the 10-year workforce plan? So, I think one of my
00:41:14.640 questions is how do we pivot to start to be able to train our workforce for the NHS of the future rather than the NHS of
00:41:20.720 the now? And how do we shift that that curricular knowledge base that we need to actually
00:41:27.040 understand what are the new tools and techniques that all our staff need to be equipped with? Yeah. And who's and whose
00:41:32.720 responsibility is it actually now that H's kind of being more merged into the um into
00:41:38.560 fantastic question Richard and about probably about a month ago we had exactly this conversation about where we
00:41:45.599 were for example in outpatients what we if we actually break through in outpatients and disrupt the model which
00:41:51.280 we have to and most people agree we need to we just can't quite find a way into
00:41:56.480 it if we're not careful we'll still spend seven years training the
00:42:01.520 clinicians have today to deliver outpatients in the way it was delivered in 1948. We can't rely upon a process that would
00:42:09.200 normally be he then NHS England with GMC the colleges you know etc would change
00:42:15.599 curricula and it would take five years to change and then it take another five years to feed through into the system.
00:42:22.480 So as well as the what we need to do from a service intent perspective and what the plan says we need to be
00:42:28.480 immediately then doing a how does this change next year how do we change what
00:42:34.240 people are being educated on in medical school or nursing school or whatever now so that quickly within 18 months maximum
00:42:42.720 they're actually delivering um in the way that we want it to be uh delivered. The hard thing to predict in
00:42:49.280 all this is the way technolog is changing but also if we follow other sectors like if we follow Banton for
00:42:55.200 example which again people get sensitive about the rate at which once we unleash it the customer changes our service
00:43:02.960 provision will be hard for us to keep up to I think we will we will have won when the
00:43:09.680 public are driving service change for us and we're struggling to keep up with them but that's a hell of a difference
00:43:16.240 from where we are now. Absolutely. Thank you for that. Okay, we've got one. We'll start with the lady
00:43:21.839 down here at the front, then we'll go all the way back to gentleman at the back.
00:43:30.480 Oh, sorry. Sorry, I didn't see you there. So, we'll start using each other. Thank you. Um, and thanks, Jim. It's
00:43:36.319 really great to hear another fellow Northern voice. Um, so it feels really comforting. um innovation and that
00:43:44.720 inability to harness innovation where you see the evidence locally within an
00:43:51.200 ICB. How do we get around that and how do we bring it to the forefront to say
00:43:57.280 look what this trust is doing? You talked about when you were in Newcastle and it was down the corridor. What if
00:44:02.800 it's just 10 miles down the road and one hospital are really driving a great innovation and getting great results in
00:44:09.119 the care pathways that you see and the demonstrating restructure of outpatient
00:44:14.319 appointments? How do we harness that? Um do we approach the hen? Do we approach
00:44:19.440 the ICB? I previously worked in the NHS for 17 years in the northeast and I see
00:44:26.160 that gap of that industry and NHS partnership. Yeah, it's a fantastic
00:44:32.640 question. So, just make a stab on it. I It's probably the ICB with the hint um
00:44:39.440 there, but you need we need a few things to happen there which are actually happening I think but happening slowly.
00:44:45.680 So, first of all, a method to share. So, often you just don't know. You know,
00:44:50.720 you'll you'll be doing something struggling with something but not really know that somebody else has already
00:44:56.720 dealt with it. We've got to find ways of that working nationally, but frankly, you've got a better chance locally of
00:45:01.760 finding ways of sharing these uh these things. I think secondly, there needs to be trust between each other because if
00:45:08.480 we're all honest, NHS people will hear that and they'll think, I'm not doing that cuz it's done in Sunderland. I'm in
00:45:13.680 Newcastle. Like, don't that can't that can't ever happen. Um so we've got to
00:45:18.720 get over ourselves on that haven't we and think about it how we work with each other are less protective less jealous
00:45:26.560 um less you know rivalry which I think the last few years has helped with certainly co I think really helped with
00:45:33.119 so um but you got to have a you know understand it have it shared and then be able to rapidly kind of knock it around
00:45:40.319 it's very hard to keep going back to the co period but in that whole remember
00:45:46.400 um and IV was said to be dangerous in Italy. It came to co when it co came to
00:45:51.920 London. London worked out it wasn't dangerous. It was actually helpful was then adopted it through the through the
00:45:58.079 the country really rapidly. We've got that we need that kind of uh pace of
00:46:03.599 change and spread etc. But also when we're doing these things also have a
00:46:08.640 mind to um how could it be scaled? How do we get beyond this just working in my
00:46:14.240 ward or my clinic? what is the way of making this thing because it is that scalability that really is the thing
00:46:20.560 that we fall down on and just we end up then with little pockets that are locked in. Yeah. And Jim as well as the ICB and the
00:46:27.280 H I mean do we have opportunities for stronger signals from the center? So I'm thinking particularly about planning
00:46:32.400 guidance you know how do we make this bring it to the attention of boards and executive teams and trusts to say that
00:46:38.319 looking out is part of the day job. Yeah. So our what we're trying to do on planning guidance, it'll not be called
00:46:45.119 planning guidance, it'll be called it's currently called planning instructions, but might be called something else by the time we do it because we're trying
00:46:51.040 to make a a shift away from this annual, you know, yellow pages type set of
00:46:57.599 instructions that that is a once a year thing to say what you've got to do. So
00:47:03.040 it'll be lighter. It'll it'll be a bit more high level. We've actually put quite a lot of it out in the letter a
00:47:08.640 couple of weeks ago as well. all sorts of signals and stuff and then through
00:47:14.000 the year be able to find ways of just updating the oversight framework as well might be something that we use and bring
00:47:20.079 to life and then the other bit sort of getting back to the earlier question is transparency
00:47:26.000 publishing making these things available there's some fantastic technology technique innovation being made
00:47:32.880 available in one place let's make that public make it then more easy for boards
00:47:39.200 to challenge Well, it's happening there. Why is it not happening here? How do we bring that to life?
00:47:44.400 Thank you. And I completely agree. Is down here, please. Thank you.
00:47:51.280 I'm sorry, just say I should have said at the start, but let us know who you are, where you're from. Yeah. Uh, thank you. Um, great to hear
00:47:57.280 you speak. I'm Reena. I'm a pharmacist by background. Um, work in consultancy supporting the NHS with delivering
00:48:02.720 transportation. So, it's been really great to hear you speak about thinking more medium to longer term thinking, but
00:48:09.280 when uh my experience and when we deliver innovation in the NHS, we're we're we're notorious for delivering
00:48:15.200 multiple pilots and we very much think very short term and and and what tends to happen is actually we've delivered
00:48:21.920 pilots and delivered really great outcomes, we then struggle to move into that scaling and sustainable way of
00:48:28.079 delivering. So are we expecting to see a shift from how we delivering funding for
00:48:34.559 innovation to think more longer term and more in that mindset of invest to save in that long term.
00:48:40.640 Yeah. So there's a couple of points in that um just to come back on. Generally,
00:48:46.480 we're going to have to start thinking more about how the business case works and less about is there a pot of money
00:48:52.240 that I've got in NHS England that you can bid for and so we we're going to try
00:48:58.400 as much as we can and we'll make a start this year and we'll have to build build up but how we allocate much more out so
00:49:05.839 it's all out it's out there and it's local so the and when and also wherever it's possible if there's a technology
00:49:12.240 and it's in a tariff based service and it works, price it in so it's in the
00:49:18.880 tariff and the expectation is it's actually used. So you're you're less than in a queue for uh for money and
00:49:26.400 working out how it kind of then gets gets adopted. The pilot thing I am
00:49:31.520 personally allergic to because generally what the that's not a corporate position
00:49:37.920 because I think what we're saying with a pilot is we actually don't believe it. Yeah. You know, we've got to get used to
00:49:43.599 the saying we'll believe it, but also if it doesn't work, if it doesn't deliver what the business case said, we'll turn
00:49:49.839 it off. You know, we'll give it a reasonable shot. And you do that in business all the time. You try something, if it didn't work, shut it
00:49:56.079 down. You try something else. We pilot on lots of things and then they kind of
00:50:02.160 get embedded and then we'll work out that they haven't done what they were going to do, but we still got the costs
00:50:07.760 locked into them. I think we really need to get out of that. Yeah, I think innovators here would agree that pilots
00:50:13.839 are often used as a very slow no. Yeah, they don't have the funding for slow nos. Let's for three more questions.
00:50:19.599 I've got two over here and we we'll have gentlemen up here first. Thanks very much. It's been a lovely
00:50:25.200 talk. Uh my name is Yeti Sham. I'm head of translation research from at the
00:50:32.240 University of Lancasher. A lot of innovation come coming from the
00:50:37.680 universities. it actually doesn't get adopted. There is a lot of barriers and especially
00:50:44.319 adoptation in the NHS is a very slow process when we compare with the other countries.
00:50:49.440 Mhm. In your 10 years plan, what you are aiming to do to shorten that pathway and
00:50:57.119 have a more clarity that that technology or innovation coming from the
00:51:02.240 institution is adopted quickly and eventually it reaches to the benefit of the patients.
00:51:07.839 Yeah. We had this discussion in the context of genomics a couple of weeks ago where if we just did everything that
00:51:16.000 we know works everywhere properly we'd be in a completely different place but
00:51:21.520 we're not and we're not doing it with other innovations clinical innovations uh etc. So we got better over the years
00:51:28.800 at uh new drugs and technique adoption through the nice process and various things but we're still really sluggish.
00:51:36.319 Um there's a bit of an appetite for that to become a bit more mandatory, be a bit
00:51:41.440 more baked into pricing and tariffs and allocation mechanisms. The assumptions
00:51:47.359 that you're doing what the best is possible to be uh to be done. So you kind of you're then incentivized to do
00:51:54.079 it, punished for not doing it if you want as well if it's a if there's a productivity benefit or a service uh
00:52:00.319 benefit. but also through the oversight framework and other things where there's really strong evidence we might have to
00:52:06.800 just mandate more and we might have to just say this isn't negotiable. It just has to happen now. And I we're
00:52:13.520 struggling with this tension because none of us want to be in a world where the center just determines everything. It's the reverse.
00:52:19.359 But there's quite a lot of it is just incredibly hard to explain to anybody.
00:52:24.800 Why is it if something just has fantastic evidence it really works, people in one place are behind it, the
00:52:30.559 NHS is going to spend 15 years working out whether it does it or not. If it was, if it were a business, it would happen overnight, wouldn't it?
00:52:38.000 Yeah. Thank you. We've got time for two more questions and we've already had some hands on the gentleman in the gray
00:52:43.200 suit. Um, oh, first of all, to my boss, Chris. Always give your boss a question.
00:52:48.400 It's Chris. I don't have to go first because I'm your boss. Anyway, thank you, Jim.
00:52:53.680 Thanks very much for coming along and taking the time because you must be insanely busy. I was reflecting that
00:53:00.400 adding things like adding quality without cost and um adopting widespread
00:53:07.119 changes takes huge time and skills and commitment and you've got that commitment from everyone here.
00:53:13.599 Do you think though in the wider management and leadership community there are gaps? I know you're going to
00:53:18.960 say there are and I think there are. I think you think there are. But what should we be doing about that? I I still
00:53:24.319 think there are people coming in to manage bits of hospitals or primary care whatever who are having to make it up as
00:53:30.880 they go along or get a bit of advice if they're lucky. Yeah. So I wonder what we should be doing and
00:53:36.480 what you think the problem is there. Yeah, great point. So I mean Sam could answer this one. So it's exactly at the
00:53:43.119 heart of the the leadership development uh question about how do we start? It's
00:53:48.720 not where we are now. that doesn't mean we can't start building something. So being clear about competencies of
00:53:55.200 managers um being clear about what courses people need to go on over time to progress,
00:54:02.800 what kind of competence do you need to get in, but also then uh progress that's going to be we're starting to build that
00:54:09.119 through SAM and other colleagues work. Uh that's a bit of a it's a bit of a
00:54:14.400 journey and the uh but the other enemy we've got is in reality operational
00:54:19.440 people have no head space. They are a combination of dealing with today
00:54:25.119 because it's necessary. If we're all really honest NHS people love the crisis. We love shortterm. We love to
00:54:33.280 have to tear the diary up because it gets you out of all those terrible meetings and you can actually do
00:54:38.400 something useful. And we do have to shift our balance and our mindset. And that's not to mean, you know, you can be
00:54:44.240 very innovative, but your wards are falling to bits or your department's falling to bits and your staff are really unhappy. We've just got to
00:54:49.839 recalibrate a little bit. And I think that's probably something we have to build gradually. We will over time be
00:54:56.960 thinking in the capability assessments do people actually have the the ability
00:55:02.160 to innovate to improve you know we actually had a discussion in execs yesterday n nationalationally about this
00:55:07.440 about really trying to cut through on what improvement really is and what capabilities people should really have
00:55:13.520 what's done centrally versus what's done locally you know etc etc and that's just in that list of things that have to be
00:55:20.079 reset thank you and we can also strengthen the offer from the graph scheme as well absolutely We don't spend enough time in
00:55:25.680 this in this agenda with the grads. Yeah. Final questions to Jasmine Black. Hi, Richard Harding from the Science and
00:55:32.480 Technologies Facilities Council. Almost as hard to say as academic health science network. Um my question is
00:55:38.319 around um skills in in social care really. So I'm passionate about digital
00:55:43.599 social care and there are a few other people in the room. Shout out Peter. Um my worry is that this billions going
00:55:50.079 into health and I'm not it's millions that's going into social care and the
00:55:55.280 gap in skills particularly around digital and leadership seems to be growing in some ways.
00:56:01.760 So I'm just thinking like for example in the Northwest I've got 150 data scientists in the NHS. I've got zero in
00:56:09.520 social care. So I'm just wondering is there any hints coming through that we're kind of leaning into this a little
00:56:14.799 bit more so we can shift you know you talk about recalibration shift the money and the skills also into social care.
00:56:23.280 It's a fantastic point actually the um tech adoption in social care is actually
00:56:28.400 really rapid as well. So I I'll be guessing at the numbers. Some a colleague mentioned it on Monday, but we
00:56:33.680 go back five years how many social care providers were actively using technology in various ways compared to what they
00:56:40.480 are now. It's it's accelerated really rapidly. It is often quite what we would regard as cheap light technology. I
00:56:48.079 think there's a bit of a lesson in that for us by the way in the NHS where we've become a bit obsessed with technology is
00:56:54.079 only worth it if it's billions of pounds. and you know having an argument with an organization at the minute who
00:57:00.000 wants to go live on an APR having spent tens of tens of millions of pounds and
00:57:05.839 I'm really worried about what it's going to do to them when they actually do go live. So we've got to get out of that I
00:57:11.920 think and start thinking about much more agile patient client orientated technology.
00:57:18.400 You'll have hopefully noted in our national structure that social care is more embraced in the national leadership
00:57:25.359 system in the new uh in the new department. So there'll be stronger clearer national leadership and the big
00:57:32.319 one of the big parts of that is being at the table with us when we're talking about things. So it's not it's not we're
00:57:38.880 doing something then someone remembers that social care are involved or there's a discharge thing or we've got to work
00:57:44.079 out how do we interact with each other. So I think over time it'll feed through because it'll just feel more mainstream.
00:57:50.720 But I think just turning your question around maybe we've maybe got more to learn
00:57:56.160 for example in NHS community services in the way that technologies be being
00:58:01.440 deployed in social care because we're still not very enabled in the NHS.
00:58:08.720 Jim, thank you so much and thank you for your questions. We could have gone on for hours I suspect but we are out of time. So, while Laura sets up our next
00:58:16.079 panel session, could I just ask you to thank the James again?
01:00:15.359 Morning
01:00:26.559 everyone. Uh that's a uh great act to follow, isn't it? So no pressure panel,
01:00:32.000 but I'm I'm sure we'll do a sterling job. My name is Laura Rooney. I'm deputy chief executive of Health Innovation
01:00:38.400 Manchester. I'm delighted to be chairing our panel discussion today and we are
01:00:43.680 talking about the uh vital importance of NHS and industry partnerships in
01:00:49.520 unlocking the potential of innovation. Um so I will allow my panel to introduce
01:00:55.760 themselves in a minute and maybe just give a brief insight into your um uh
01:01:01.280 particular thoughts on on this this topic and then I will start off with a series of questions but really keen to
01:01:07.920 have an interactive experience with our audience. So please do start jotting down your thoughts and questions. Um so
01:01:15.280 I think Jim underlined the the kind of pressures that the system faces and uh
01:01:21.200 of course those pressures uh have been around for a long time. So this is not particularly new but it does feel um
01:01:28.480 quite a precarious time for the NHS given some of the statistics Jim described. Um however the opportunities
01:01:37.280 that that presents is to be um transformational, harness innovation and really imagine um how health and care is
01:01:44.960 delivered. And I think we would all in this room believe industry is is vital
01:01:50.079 um to support us with with that endeavor. So we've got a fantastic panel today with a blend of uh experiences
01:01:57.760 from NHS, trade bodies, national organizations and industry. Um, and if
01:02:03.599 we just start uh with Steve, you just say a quick hello and introduce yourself and then we'll just go down the uh down
01:02:11.520 the line if that's okay. Good good morning everyone. Uh, my name is Steve Bates. I'm the new executive
01:02:17.520 chair of the Office of Life Sciences for the UK government. It's my third day in the job, so please be kind.
01:02:26.400 Uh, so it's all Richard's fault I'm here. He nobleled me before I started. I used to be at the bio industry association and used to be on the COVID
01:02:32.880 vaccine task force with Kate Bingham. Thank you. Um I'm Helen Dent. I'm chief
01:02:39.359 executive of BIVDA. BIVDA is the National Trade Association for Diagnostics Companies, manufacturers and
01:02:45.839 um consultants and silly industries. I'm very pleased to be here today. Thank you.
01:02:52.400 Good morning everyone. I'm Fiona Edwards. I'm the uh northeast Yorkshire regional director of NHS England. Um
01:02:59.760 this is my beginning of my seventh month in post. Um my career spans uh 25 odd
01:03:06.559 years as a chief exec in the NHS and providers uh particularly mental health
01:03:12.240 learning disabilities working in partnership with social care and or latally in the integrated care board
01:03:19.039 world. So I'm delighted to be with you today. Morning everybody. I'm Sam Allen. I'm
01:03:24.720 the chief executive of the Northeast North Integrated Care Board. Um, probably a sort of a lifelong servant of
01:03:30.720 the NHS, but I have also had a couple of years experience working outside of the NHS as well um in in industry. So, have
01:03:38.559 a kind of perspective of being on the outside looking in um which which was which was an amazing time actually. I
01:03:45.520 learned loads, but also it taught me about some of the challenges of working with us um from a a a customer client
01:03:52.720 perspective. So really great to be here. Thanks. And uh good morning everyone.
01:03:57.920 I'm Mandy Ridge. I'm the business advisor to the mayor of West Yorkshire Braven. I also chair the West Yorkshire
01:04:04.319 Innovation Network and have an engineering company myself working in aerospace um semiconductors and medical
01:04:12.480 devices. Thanks so much. Um, and just to reintroduce, um, myself, um, I'm Anna
01:04:18.400 Race. I work as the director of health system engagement and partnership at Binger Engleheim. Um, a couple of years
01:04:23.760 ago, I had the opportunity to be able to transform our operating model because we recognize the need to be able to partner
01:04:29.440 and collaborate more with the NHS. And so, we have been doing that over the last couple of years. Um, some of it's
01:04:34.799 gone well. Um, we're still learning a lot. Um, and you know, I'm really excited to be able to share some of our experiences with you today.
01:04:41.920 Awesome. Thank you. Um, so I'm going to start off with a fairly easy one for you all uh to to get us warmed up for the uh
01:04:49.440 conversation. So um obviously I think everyone in this room is bought in to
01:04:54.880 this the uh need for NHS and industry partnerships. Um from your perspective
01:05:01.119 given what we heard from Jim just before and kind of your own experience of of what's going on in the real world, what
01:05:07.280 do you think's the biggest opportunity right now for NHS and industry partnerships? And have you got any
01:05:13.440 particular examples you you'd like to share? That's an open question. So, anyone who feels they want to go first?
01:05:19.520 What's the the biggest opportunity we've got right now? Where would you where would you place your bets?
01:05:26.640 Happy to have a go. Um, okay. So, I think that we heard um Jim talking about the three big shifts.
01:05:33.039 Um, and I think we would probably all collectively recognize that when we can
01:05:38.079 really pull together and focus um in a specific uh way in a specific area, um, we can make really big changes happen.
01:05:46.079 Um, and when I think about that, I think around um, moving hospital care into community, I think about treatment um,
01:05:52.559 into prevention. Um, I think about obviously analog into digital. And when we think about those sorts of examples
01:05:58.480 and the type of work specifically that we're trying to make on a population health level in the systems, I think
01:06:04.480 that there are some quick wins to be able to be made and equally there's some longerterm pieces that we need to be able to solve. Um we've got examples of
01:06:12.079 those um of which I'm not necessarily going to go into um a lot of multiple examples with individuals and and teams
01:06:17.599 from a um that are here today. Um and um
01:06:22.960 I do believe that um we will have to learn together. Um we'll have to be
01:06:28.720 thinking about outcomes and success and impact at the start of the work that we
01:06:33.839 do if we're really going to try and deliver on some of the biggest challenges that health systems have.
01:06:39.280 Should I go? Yeah, yeah. Well, we had um a couple of clues from Jim's opening address, didn't we?
01:06:45.200 Um so if you think about uh what I was really struck by his characterization of our operating model in the NHS being a
01:06:52.720 1948 model um and the connection with the the need for uh deploying uh
01:06:59.359 workforce reductions and staff uh in the right way and then the connection with making a digital um uh shift and
01:07:07.440 certainly my experience and there's a lot of work going on now I've had experience of working in the digital
01:07:12.880 shared care record base which um transforms clinical practice in terms of
01:07:18.799 access to information not only from health but social care uh residential
01:07:24.319 care uh partnerships certainly in in the system I worked with in the southeast
01:07:29.599 and um those but they require absolute clarity of purpose of all the partners
01:07:36.559 in joining in together health leading with the clear time scale and kind of
01:07:42.400 imperative and sense of urgy gency for implementing change, but fundamentally a
01:07:48.319 depth of relational um partnering with uh industry partners internal to the NHS
01:07:55.839 and the public sector system as well and those create the conditions for those opportunities to be seized. So, it's
01:08:02.240 kind of digital workforce reform um and really a mindset of how we live our
01:08:08.400 lives now in the 21st century. Yes. So I think one of the biggest
01:08:13.520 opportunities is harnessing the expertise of our health innovation network. So um in the northeast north
01:08:18.960 Cumbria we've got a really vibrant ecosystem and we have huge amounts of knowledge and expertise that sits in a
01:08:25.198 health innovation network. And I remember when I arrived um in the north I'm from the northeast by the way. I
01:08:30.399 don't sound like I am but when I arrived back home in the northeast um uh about four years ago we could see all this
01:08:36.880 amazing work going on but it was like we was we were in silos really. We haven't joined up the dots. And I feel like
01:08:42.080 we've we've definitely come a long way, but we've got so much more opportunity to do more together. Um, so having
01:08:49.120 really clear innovation pathway, having really aligned priorities. So we
01:08:54.399 developed our clinical condition strategy. So we're really clear and we can signal to industry and partners,
01:09:00.719 these are the key conditions in our area that we want to focus on. Come and help us with those. Um, women's health became
01:09:07.839 a big priority for us last year. So we've done a feech accelerator. How do we um bring the sort of the vibrancy of
01:09:14.640 the sector in? But equally to Jim's point um we've just signed off our urgent emergency care plan at our board
01:09:20.719 yesterday and point of care testing in our respiratory hubs is going to be
01:09:25.839 something we're going to do a test and learn on this year and actually if we can through the point of care testing
01:09:32.000 our hypothesis is we could prevent then further attendances at ED then we'll scale it next year. So I think if we can
01:09:39.759 get simple business rules, really clear alignment and prioritization so that we
01:09:46.319 can signal to industry come and work with us and then have um commissioning
01:09:51.359 processes that support that. I think that's a massive opportunity. And then just finally I was really struck by the
01:09:57.360 1948 analogy as well and I love that saying the systems perfectly designed to get the results it gets. And I was
01:10:03.199 thinking about high street banking. So, you know, some of you may know people that work in high street banking. So,
01:10:08.800 their business model, they've got banks still in some high streets, but obviously they've gone online, but they
01:10:14.560 have a corporate center that does all of their product development and then they implement it. The operational managers
01:10:20.560 work to a set of standards. They're implementing things. Absolutely. Can come up with ideas. And I think we've
01:10:26.080 got to really challenge ourselves and health service about where does the product development happen and then how
01:10:32.560 connected does that then get to the front line. And if we've got um over 200
01:10:38.800 individual individual systems and parts of systems doing everything their own
01:10:44.239 way, it's no wonder we get the results we get. So I think we need to be a bit bolder on a small number of priorities
01:10:51.440 that we scale and do really well for patients. Okay. And uh just a thought from Helen
01:10:57.520 and then we'll go to the next question. Thank you. So um a couple of things that um the lady just said a moment ago um
01:11:04.560 and also what um Jim mentioned. I think that certainly that one of the biggest
01:11:11.120 opportunities is engagement and because of that engagement this is from an industry perspective. So I'm obviously
01:11:17.440 um talk to members and companies all the time and what has actually historically been really difficult is the ability to
01:11:24.080 talk to people who are doing the jobs and the people who are doing the jobs are the ones who are organically telling
01:11:29.840 the industry what that demand is. So therefore, what we've been getting, and
01:11:34.880 this is anecdotal, and one day I would really like to prove it when it quietens down a little bit. But um what we're
01:11:41.040 getting now is disruptive technologies that come through based on what people think the system needs. What we haven't
01:11:48.560 got and which I think we can really really increase is when we get what I refer to as ondemand innovation. So they
01:11:55.280 understand what is needed in those situations and that's observed and it's
01:12:00.640 understood and it's it's to answer questions that people haven't realized are questions and we're about a 10
01:12:07.280 certainly in our industry we're about a 10 year lag on that because it has been so busy and difficult to do that that we
01:12:13.679 haven't got all of the potential innovations through that could have been delivered. So I think engagement and
01:12:19.760 understanding and I think going back to the 1948 point as well is we have to learn how to work with each other
01:12:26.719 because there is R&D engagement which is entirely different to the eight weeks
01:12:33.280 before procurement engagement which is entirely different to after that in the contract engagement and to have
01:12:39.840 suppliers and companies not allowed in to see people is causing a problem massively for innovation and with the
01:12:46.719 plans the 10 year plan and everything that's being said today while change is in the air I think we should absolutely
01:12:53.040 take it. Thanks Helen. Um so I'm going to come to Steve. Um so three days in but I'm sure
01:12:59.920 like the rest of us you have read the life sciences sector plan cover to cover. I did that was the sun lounger reading
01:13:06.159 in the summer. Um and obviously that um is is a plan that was um well aligned with the
01:13:13.280 10-year health plan. It was nice to see both of those national documents with with a good degree of alignment which is
01:13:18.960 critical for the optimization of innovation. So three days in what are your top priorities or hopes and what's
01:13:27.199 getting in the way? So I thought better have an initial plan at least when you're turning up to talk. So I thought three letters would do it
01:13:33.520 DTC. So I think my initial plan is to focus on data. We've got immense to
01:13:38.560 answer the question before we've got immense opportunities in data. uh and we've got a plan to transform that and
01:13:44.560 actually when I talk to venture capitalists and the big companies that are interested in the UK they're very interested in what we're doing in health
01:13:50.640 data and we can see some big investments coming there um trials we're fantastic
01:13:55.679 at getting quality data out of trials we need to be faster um and we need to uh think very cleverly about how we do that
01:14:02.159 and I'm very keen that if Jim has one thing in his plan uh it's that it's the 150day target that's in both the NHS
01:14:09.199 plan and the life science plan and C is capital uh and by capital I mean money into companies, scale up capital to get
01:14:16.560 money into companies to grow, but it's also about solving some of the big problems that we're seeing with drug pricing that are causing barriers. I
01:14:23.600 think the other thing we should just do is jump up and down about the successes. You Richard, you I mean Richard tells us
01:14:29.199 we had 500 million pound investment in Manchester from a from a from a health tech company this morning. Now everyone
01:14:36.000 will remember MSD last week and a billion pound out of out of London. Well, that's 2-1. We've got one back
01:14:42.239 already, right? I I may not be a judy, but I am a Gilligan fan and I know that
01:14:47.360 we need a one, you know, one back in a week is pretty good going. And I just
01:14:52.960 think we should be really confident. There's fundamentally that the world wants to come and work with the UK.
01:14:58.480 Tough environment, tough global environment, but actually we just need to celebrate this stuff a bit more. I
01:15:04.080 think we should put we need some candles. We need a cake. We need uh uh if you've been to City Labs and and seen
01:15:09.360 the the the the stuff down down down on the south side of Manchester, it's fantastic. I mean, that's going to be full of people working for the next 10
01:15:15.120 years as a result of this. That is what this is about. Anyone want to build on any of that?
01:15:20.159 Don't worry, I've got plenty of questions. Yeah. Um I was going to come to uh Mandy next. So Mandy um the
01:15:28.400 government have reaffirmed its commitment to growth as being one of the the biggest mission perhaps for the
01:15:34.000 government. We heard that in K Star Dmer's uh speech yesterday. Um could you
01:15:39.840 just explain what that means from a placebased city region perspective? What what what is the the role of placebased
01:15:46.560 economic growth and how can NHS industry partnerships contribute to that agenda?
01:15:51.920 Okay, it's quite a big question but I I'll try and summarize. Um so in West Yorkshire um we've had to put a local
01:15:58.880 growth plan together like every other mayoral authority in the country and within that um our clusters are
01:16:05.120 absolutely key to driving that growth. I mean the country needs growth. It's challenging at the moment for the UK and
01:16:11.360 trying to make sure that that growth comes to West Yorkshire is part of my role. One of our clusters is health tech
01:16:17.120 and we are have 160 million pounds to spend over the next 10 years on our investment zone. We already have a huge
01:16:24.480 cluster of businesses here working in data devices and um diagnostics. Um and
01:16:31.360 so building on that is important. We talked about um trials earlier and we
01:16:37.360 talked about innovation. I think from a business point of view what businesses need is the ability to trigger demand
01:16:44.880 from successful trials. We spend a lot of time or businesses tell me that we spend a lot of time in the NHS triing
01:16:51.520 things and then not getting anywhere to the next stage. So when government is putting in money into incubators and
01:16:58.800 accelerators, if those successful trials don't then convert to quick demands, we
01:17:05.679 are wasting money on that runway working capital. So no matter how many venture cap capitalists want to invest in those
01:17:14.080 um businesses, there is an issue with being able to um to stay alive. It's survival of of the longevity rather than
01:17:21.280 survival of the the fittest. So we really need to think about that as a as an NHS organization. I think the other
01:17:28.480 point for driving growth is the points that were made earlier around capitalizing on best practice and in
01:17:35.120 business you know you do that really quickly and I think that point was was made well where is the communication for
01:17:41.360 showing off what you've done in your trust or in your area so that other people can read that you know a Facebook
01:17:48.239 for the NHS of the things that are going well where do we share best practice so that everybody can learn from it and can
01:17:55.120 we do that from any level rather than just from the the CEOs of the organizations. I think that's important.
01:18:01.040 So in West Yorkshire, I think the important thing for us is how do we help our businesses to start up? How do we
01:18:08.480 help them to scale up? And both of those things are related to um to that runway
01:18:14.480 and also how do we attract more domestic and international businesses here to set
01:18:20.000 up. The investment zone is part of that. The ecosystem which we have here in West Yorkshire is part of that. going
01:18:27.120 overseas. Our health um bridge with Nashville for example will be part of that. But all of that is down to speed
01:18:34.400 to market from a business perspective and also communication at a very noisy
01:18:40.719 level. Yeah, of course. Um and I think you know the point's been
01:18:45.840 raised about sharing best practice quite a lot, but you know what we don't necessarily do is we don't necessarily
01:18:51.040 share about when things don't go well and learn about when things haven't gone so well. Um, and you know, there's very
01:18:57.440 often times where something might not necessarily be deemed to be successful within a particular locality, but that
01:19:03.280 doesn't mean to say that it wouldn't work somewhere else in the country. Um, and I think as British, you know, we're
01:19:08.320 not typically great at putting our hands up and saying, "Hey, we didn't do a particularly great job at this." We tend to celebrate success. We tend to
01:19:14.800 celebrate when things go well. Maybe we need to start challenging ourselves a little bit more to be talking about when
01:19:19.920 things don't. Um I'm going to come to uh Fiona and Sam
01:19:26.719 if that's okay. So the 10-year health plan is is very pro- innovation uh we
01:19:32.080 would say uh and underlines the importance of the relationship with industry in delivery of that ambition.
01:19:38.560 How is that translating at the moment down into uh health systems? Um it's
01:19:44.239 still fairly new plan and there's a lot of complexity as as Jim um outlined. So,
01:19:49.840 is the NHS ready to embrace this opportunity if we still got work to do?
01:19:55.760 So, well, I think it it's a mixed picture, isn't it? And so what we're trying to do nationally is to be really
01:20:03.440 clear about shifting the way the NHS and as it develops and merges with the
01:20:09.840 department of health social care to be um much more about standards less about
01:20:16.159 trying to give direction on everything. So in in the space around innovation and
01:20:22.000 support, it's really important that we know and my experience is that we know
01:20:27.679 the best innovations happen where you have a climate created through very robust local place-based relationships
01:20:36.719 um and a clarity of agenda for the locality, the place, clarity of agenda
01:20:42.880 for the partner organizations in there that create a climate for uh innovation
01:20:48.640 to happen. And in in terms of addressing the here and now challenges that we've got across public service in terms of
01:20:55.600 all of us having to reform meet increased demand that um the nationally
01:21:03.360 uh what we're in up for and you'll hear more of about this from Tom Ruden this afternoon I'm sure is um how
01:21:10.960 demonstrating the core frameworks for component parts of the NHS to operate
01:21:18.880 So being really clear about provider strength and capability in supporting uh
01:21:25.120 developing high performing organizations that can work autonomously and freely
01:21:31.280 and part of the test of that and as we move into regulating for that will be
01:21:36.880 how robust and clear organizational strategies are for embracing partnerships, embracing innovation to
01:21:44.719 deliver their clinical strategy goals. and then um and demonst demonstrating a
01:21:50.400 pattern uh and potential for delivery. So that uh that's the kind of change
01:21:56.719 that we we're into now both from a national, regional and local level. And
01:22:02.960 I'm sure Sam can expand on that. Yeah. So I mean I think I think we need to be kind of I'm a I'm quite a sort of
01:22:09.520 pragmatist and a realist and I think we probably all know it is tough at the moment and I think um people are finding
01:22:17.360 it challenging. I think the whole geopolitical environment never mind what we're you know grappling with um in in
01:22:25.120 health. Having said that I sense a real kind of sense of energy and optimism
01:22:31.120 around actually the case for change has been made really clear. We heard that again from Jim this morning and I think
01:22:37.199 we are at a sort of a tipping point really um when it comes to the health service which is we we have got to we've
01:22:44.560 got to keep the show on the road but we have to transform out of this that that isn't optional now for us and when I
01:22:50.880 think about the north I and I think about innovation and we often think about whether it's diagnostics or tech
01:22:57.360 and as Jim said it means different things to different people I think our greatest asset actually are our people
01:23:03.440 and And I think we need to really double down on providing them with the
01:23:09.040 opportunity to innovate and harnessing their expertise as opposed to um the
01:23:15.679 daily grind of work at the moment. So it it's a privilege, isn't it, for all of us to be sat here today. There are lots
01:23:22.800 of people who would like to be sat in this room today, not just the ones online, but people working in ED
01:23:28.800 departments, still in outpatients departments, in general practice, dealing with the 8 a.m. rush. So, um it
01:23:36.639 it is incumbent upon us to make those changes. So, I think there was a genuine excitement and I was really encouraged when the neighborhood health um national
01:23:43.840 program came out. We had nine applications across the northeast, North Cumbra. That was testimony, I think, to
01:23:51.280 that level of optimism and motivation that still sits in people to make the change. And I think um we we need to
01:23:58.320 harness that, but we've got to back it up with the support. We've got to back it up with the support. Um whether
01:24:03.679 that's um still finding ways to be creative with some of the money on innovation.
01:24:09.360 um having much simpler business rules around commercial relationships with
01:24:14.480 industry because it's probably a bit like penetrating Fort Knox, isn't it? Trying to get to a decision maker um who
01:24:21.199 will kind of agree to things and even as a chief executive I can guide and coach but you want people to get there but you
01:24:27.840 still have to kind of go down and knock down a few doors. So I I think we have got to celebrate. So, bit of a shameless
01:24:34.320 plug. Just finally, we are doing learning and improvement in the northeast North Cumbra. If you go on to
01:24:40.000 boost uh boost.org, you've have the opportunity to join our learning and improvement community. We've got 18,000
01:24:46.080 members now where we've got communities of practice. We've got um lived
01:24:51.120 experience of where people are improving services and learning together. Um and
01:24:56.880 that does include failure learning as well, which is really important as part of the test for change. Um, so I' I'd
01:25:03.040 really encourage you all to kind of come and join us. But I think if we can unlock the optimism in people and we can
01:25:08.320 then back it up with a prioritization of innovation working with our health
01:25:13.600 innovation networks, then we stand a chance. Awesome. Um, I'm going to come to the
01:25:18.719 audience in a minute. So just give you a chance to uh think of your questions. So, conversely to sort of Anna and Steve
01:25:26.320 and perhaps Helen, how can the NHS be a a better partner for industry? What are
01:25:32.960 the things you would hope to see um over the coming years?
01:25:38.639 I can Oh, sorry. I can start with that actually and be very careful with the
01:25:44.080 next sentence because it needs to be listened to carefully. is that increased profit for industry does not mean
01:25:50.560 increased prices for the people who are procuring the products and the innovations. I think what we need to do
01:25:58.000 and where we can support and where you can support us is to look at taking the things that put the cost into the supply
01:26:04.800 chain out. This means because with industry they are the third point on the
01:26:10.880 triangle in sustainability. They are the economy. They are economics. Most of the innovators arememes.
01:26:18.560 They've got local employment. They've got national insurance problems. They have got they want to grow, but they
01:26:24.639 can't. They're spending their potential profits on keeping their business afloat, which means they're not
01:26:30.480 naturally they're not putting their own R&D reinvestment into them. So what we need to make sure that we do or what we
01:26:36.639 can do and this is a big change into partnership is say what do you need to do to be around still and to still be
01:26:43.440 able to continue to perform and operate in the UK and then pay that amount of money and that amount of money can be
01:26:50.719 lower. It can even be lower than it is today if you take some of the costs that are not required out of that system. So
01:26:57.760 it's the bottom line and it's the profit increases not the cost that increases. It sounds very basic, but the whole
01:27:04.000 system isn't set up to do that. So, I think that is something that would be really useful to work on to see how you
01:27:10.560 can then invest in your local suppliers by buying for the health service as mentioned earlier.
01:27:18.080 Off to you. Okay. Yeah. So, I think I' I'd make two points. One
01:27:24.960 is I think there's we can and I'm trying out new material here. Um, so help tell
01:27:30.320 me if I've got this entirely wrong. Uh, because I'm I'm I know a couple people in this audience, but I'm used to speaking to industry audiences. So,
01:27:36.719 well, you might get booed then. So, so I I hope I hope I won't. But one of the things that I think of that I
01:27:42.560 think the NHS sometimes think of is that industry is distant, i.e. it's big farmer
01:27:47.760 and big farmer is something that is away that's sort of either in America or
01:27:53.520 somewhere else. Who here in the room is paid for by industry? Put your hands up.
01:27:59.520 So these are your colleagues. These are people in our communities. These are the people here. These are the job. Now the
01:28:04.960 scary thing is these are the jobs that can be moved to Australia. These are the jobs. Now the NHS is not going to move
01:28:10.800 that many jobs to Australia, to Spain, to America, to China. The life science
01:28:16.320 industry is global. It will make choices and and and it will survive whether the NHS does or not.
01:28:23.199 Right? That's the brutal truth of it. Now the trick for us is to think actually These industry colleagues are
01:28:29.920 part of the NHS community. That's how I would see it. Tell me if I get come up to me over the coffee to tell me how to
01:28:36.560 get this bleach better. But that's the point that actually the option is do we have these people working with us with
01:28:43.040 the NHS doing this stuff or is it going to go somewhere else? And in the world of geopolitics where for the first time
01:28:48.639 in my working life tariffs will be imposed on pharmaceutical products 15%
01:28:53.760 below the US on uh on on Europe. We don't yet know the position in the UK.
01:28:58.880 These will drive business decisions and we still don't know exactly on med devices and other things. So there's a whole host of uncertainty. Now it may be
01:29:05.600 that we're in a very competitive advantage because the prime minister has done a great job with the president and the king's done a great job at the state
01:29:11.920 dinner or we might be in a very bad place. I don't know. But actually some of that will be will be driving this. So
01:29:18.719 I think that's number one. These this these are part of our ecosystem and we should think about it that way around.
01:29:25.920 Um, what else could the NHS do? Speed. The only other thing I say, speed. Uh,
01:29:31.840 and that's my vaccine task force heritage. I mean, you know, we we could move it all. I just played a very small
01:29:37.679 part in putting Oxford together as I know that we did that really really fast. Then we did stuff in car parks and
01:29:42.800 then made some big mistakes in test track and trace which I'm always happy to tell people about as well. Um, but
01:29:48.159 yeah, um, speed speed really matters for lots of reasons and I I think it's just understanding that. if you get a chance
01:29:54.400 and you're doing innovation, can you do it 8:40 on a Monday morning rather than Thursday afternoon?
01:30:01.120 Anna Jeff. Um, so Steve's kind of stole my thumb on that one. I was I was going to say um
01:30:07.679 for me it would be see us as a partner. Um, and so, you know, what we want when we're building partnerships is, you
01:30:14.239 know, we don't want to come in to work with you and, you know, build something for a couple of years, deliver it, and
01:30:20.080 then walk away and see the fruits of our labor dissipate. Um, you know, we want to see um scalability. We want to see uh
01:30:27.840 sustainability. And so at the start of the work that we're trying to do and build with you, be upfront, be candid
01:30:34.639 about what it is that you're trying to achieve, how you want to measure success, so that as we're going through
01:30:40.719 that partnership together, we can talk about are we succeeding or are we failing and we can keep ourselves on the
01:30:46.239 right path or not. Um, and I think if we're able to do that and really think at the start of the types of
01:30:51.679 partnerships that we're building, how will this be sustained? How will this be commissioned as business as usual for
01:30:58.480 your systems afterwards? That's where we're going to kind of really start to make the changes that we need to. So, I
01:31:04.000 would say see us as a partner um and make sure that we have a seat around the table right at the very start of the
01:31:10.400 planning. Awesome. Any thoughts? No. Uh any questions from the audience? Charlotte,
01:31:17.199 hello. You'll have a mic arriving. There you go. Behind you. Thank you. Hi, I'm Charlotte Lewis from
01:31:24.080 Mills and Reeves. So, I'm a commercial lawyer and I work on both sides of the fence. So, um never on the same deal
01:31:30.719 obviously. Um but in my experience, um Jim talked about the almost the
01:31:37.440 competitiveness, the rivalry, the jealousy, whatever that exists or can exist between NHS organizations.
01:31:44.480 when I am negotiating relationships between NHS and industry, often what is
01:31:50.239 described as a partnership doesn't look like a partnership on paper. Um, and so I think it's really important that in
01:31:58.080 order to talk about speed and, you know, removing red tape and that sort of thing, I think it's really important
01:32:04.159 actually for your procurement and contractual documentation to describe something that is a bit more like a partnership if that is what you're
01:32:10.080 intending to do. And I would just kind of to build on the points that you've all already said really just like to
01:32:15.760 hear your thoughts around that. I think the 10-year plan does just lean into that a little bit as well, which is
01:32:21.360 really helpful. But I think that there's more can be done and I think it's about, you know, being clear about what the
01:32:26.639 relationship is and and being um open-minded to a slightly different relationship as well.
01:32:32.960 Anyone got any thoughts on that? Yeah. Fiona, Hannah. Yeah. Um uh so I think you on
01:32:40.880 appointments critical for um being able to really get the best out of all
01:32:47.040 partners is that you uh rather than so so I agree and and um in terms of my
01:32:53.920 experience and where I would like to see us get to is that we um build uh
01:33:01.360 networks of relationships locally between component parts of the NHS and
01:33:06.960 industry. build relationships before you even get into contractual and you just
01:33:12.239 explore the opportunities together which is where the health innovation networks really supports that but that you are
01:33:19.280 absolutely clear of the joint goal to which you're then getting into a legal
01:33:24.320 relationship and it's a joint goal but the interests of all the partners are
01:33:30.000 slightly different and you look for alignment and you you build you have a a dialogue between all the partners and
01:33:36.400 where I've seen it work incredibly well and you can make it work. Is that uh and what I would look from a regulatory
01:33:43.360 point of view in terms of testing contractual arrangements is is there
01:33:48.400 clarity of each of the component roles that partners make? Is that has it been
01:33:54.000 built through mutual respect and regard and understanding and is the outcome
01:34:00.560 really going to tangibly everyone understands the benefit the communities and populations and the change and h and
01:34:08.159 but some of that stuff takes a long time to build before you actually get into
01:34:13.199 the delivery side of things. And so we've got to pace is really important
01:34:18.400 but having a climate in at place and locally the investment in that takes years um
01:34:26.000 and I think the north and northeast I come from the south has got the best opportunity the collaborations I can see
01:34:32.880 in different places across the region we're really set fair to take advantage
01:34:38.480 but if if we see the contractual bit as where we're all going to fall out over the the money and who's going
01:34:45.679 you've got to really go into that eyes open and um understand that there will be difficult conversations along the way
01:34:52.639 as well. You can't avoid them. So that's kind of where I'm at with that. I think Helen
01:35:10.639 I was going to say that that's exactly the point is you need to pick your partnerships the ones that are going to
01:35:16.560 give you the biggest benefit and also things to avoid. It's almost like
01:35:22.800 don't try and get savings out of that contract and don't try and put penalties and KPIs into those contracts because
01:35:28.960 the minute you've got those, those are when you actually had the adversarial relationships which were designed in
01:35:34.080 1948 since we're going back to that point. But partnership has to be an equal relationship and some contracts
01:35:42.960 just can't. If it's a service delivery, if it's something like that where there is something that you need to measure,
01:35:48.239 it's probably not your best idea for a partnership. And um so I think it it's contractual
01:35:55.520 arrangements there to protect both both partners. So whether it is a big company
01:36:01.520 like the NHS, if that's indeed a company, a big organization and a small company, it's really important that you
01:36:07.760 take advice. Um in terms of those, I think businesses are generally grown up.
01:36:12.880 Um, I sign contracts with Airbus and Boeing directly where I'm a small player and they're absolutely huge. So, I'm
01:36:19.040 used to those contractual arrangements and I know that lots of other companies within this arena are the same. But,
01:36:25.120 it's making sure that we don't overengineer contracts for things that don't need to be overengineered because
01:36:30.480 that puts in cost that it shouldn't. So I think making sure we have light touch contracts at the right point but the
01:36:37.280 right protection at the right point is important for developing businesses also
01:36:42.880 growing the ecosystem. So again in West Yorkshire something that we're working on and we have a great a great here
01:36:50.880 working on that with those businesses is important to making sure we share those
01:36:56.239 um that thinking and help businesses that aren't as off with contractual obligations. um understand those early
01:37:03.600 doors so they don't sign up to something that then takes them under. We have got two questions over here. Uh
01:37:09.760 if you could just raise your hand. Thank you. Thank you. I'm Andy Hilton. I'm a GP and and chief executive primary care
01:37:15.840 Sheffield. So the 10-year plan describes the importance of upstream interventions
01:37:20.880 and and prevention. Uh Sam mentioned the national neighborhood implementation program and so I'm really interested in
01:37:27.760 how um we ensure that innovation and and future interventions are focused around
01:37:33.440 that upstream agenda. How we reach out and make sure that communities particularly underserved communities um
01:37:39.600 you know the innovations to support their needs rather than just focusing on perhaps downstream interventions later
01:37:46.320 on in a in a disease process whether that be drugs or other technology. thoughts, Sam?
01:37:53.199 Yeah, really good point. Um, and great work you're doing in Sheffield as well.
01:37:58.400 I know that we're looking at that. Um, I mean, I I think it's probably where most of the innovation needs to happen.
01:38:03.600 Actually, in some ways, we're going to ask ourselves where haven't sort of the other stuff. I think that's much more cultural than it is um innovation. But
01:38:11.840 um I mean we're doing some stuff with Boinger um on chronic kidney disease
01:38:17.119 particularly around um identifying patients in underserved um communities.
01:38:22.159 Um and I think again it comes down to what are the local priorities that have been set and harnessing the innovation
01:38:29.679 and the focus around that. So I mean on our neighborhood um we we got two of the
01:38:35.280 seven onto the national program but actually we're going to proceed with the other seven and we're forming local
01:38:40.480 communities of practice and a real focus around that to uh support their learning but I think it is about just being clear
01:38:46.960 about what those priorities are and getting it aligned. I mean, some of the really simple stuff I think that hasn't
01:38:52.639 helped relationships with industry have been things that have happened to people
01:38:58.320 where sometimes actually they haven't had some of the rigor and the formality that's been needed. They have had a
01:39:04.960 relationship, they've had a trust and then they've got their fingers really badly burnt because somebody's come in and said you haven't followed proper
01:39:11.199 governance and then it just puts people off being and they become far less risk
01:39:16.239 averse when it comes to innovation. So if we can get the business rules, you know, I know Nick, we've done a lot of
01:39:22.080 work on our intellectual property uh policy. So we're really clear on that. As I said, we've done our approach on
01:39:27.840 working formally with commercial organizations. If we can simplify the touch points and give key points of
01:39:33.840 relationships, I think we'll just stand a better chance of having more, I think, productive um relationships with
01:39:40.800 industry as opposed to perhaps some of the the the the things haven't gone as well in the past. We certainly like lots
01:39:48.080 of governance in the NHS, don't we? Uh, we do. We do. And we like lots of red tape. And I think again, our job is to
01:39:54.320 try and, you know, Fiona and I would talk about this, try and simplify this. And I think with the new operating
01:39:59.600 model, we should do that. And I think for ICBS, as we go on this journey to becoming strategic commissioners where
01:40:05.600 we're going to be very focused on, you know, my job is going to be driving the best value for the NHS pound, the best
01:40:12.000 outcomes. So we've got to have the curiosity to explore why some areas are
01:40:17.280 getting better results than others and then we've got to set the specifications and expect other services to be fast
01:40:23.520 followers of that and adopt that innovation. And I think we've got a real opportunity as strategic commissioners
01:40:29.440 to mandate the adoption of proven technology and innovation that drives um
01:40:36.000 efficiencies because I I always think that as a patient I want to have access
01:40:42.159 to the best the best available um therapies, the best available diagnostics. And so if we've got an
01:40:50.000 evidence particularly upstream where that's working, it's our role as commissioners to scale that.
01:40:55.840 Can can I just pick up on a point you almost threw away at the end where you sort of said not spend it on drugs
01:41:01.440 because that's not prevention with the implication that that's not prevention. I spend a lot of time at have done until
01:41:07.600 this week with the cutting edge of drug companies and biotech companies and they
01:41:12.639 think that they are producing things that will prevent disease in the future.
01:41:18.320 So they're looking at cancer vaccines and they really think that there's the potential there. Now I don't know whether it will work but I
01:41:24.560 think we need to think about and this is what's really hard is how do we think now we've talked about 1948 let's talk
01:41:29.679 about 2048. If we're in China we don't talk about the past we talk about the future. So, how do we talk about where
01:41:36.159 this is going? I look at the fact that you can do polygenic risk scoring now
01:41:41.679 and that's available from a UK um biotech bio biotech startup to quite a
01:41:47.679 large proportion off the back of fantastic NHS longitudinal data. I don't think it's that hard to bring some of
01:41:54.480 that thinking into what might enable communities that you serve to stratify
01:42:01.520 them into some things that would enable that to work. I don't quite know how to do it and I'd love to come and talk to you over coffee about more about how we
01:42:06.960 do this. But I'm interested in how we can do that and maybe we can link up
01:42:12.000 some of the stuff that's already there with some of this. That's where I'm thinking there's opportunity and I hope
01:42:17.600 we can do over the time of the 10 year plan. Thank you. Um sir in the pink shirt
01:42:22.639 we've just got a question over here. Is there a microphone? Oh, you've got it already. Well done. Hi, thank you. Uh Craig Wood from First
01:42:29.040 Late Bank. Uh we're a leading provider of clinical decision support across the NHS. Proud to be working with Northeast
01:42:35.520 North Cumbria already and also Greater Manchester and we've just uh started working with the progress team out of
01:42:41.199 Manchester University. So yeah, already supporting you guys in the north. Uh my question was around the the accelerating
01:42:48.000 transformation and how often there's a barrier of entry around what is a goal here. Um I think we all agree sish room
01:42:55.679 we're focusing on the patient outcome and the clinical outcomes for patients. But once you have that conversation, it
01:43:01.119 then falls back to well what's the return on investment and it becomes a procurement conversation and you know
01:43:06.560 the narrative on the ground at the moment is with everything going on innovation stops because there's no
01:43:12.159 money nobody can make a decision nobody can sign off a business case. So I think
01:43:17.199 my question to the panel is have you got any insight on how we navigate that both now because there's a lot of innovation
01:43:23.199 partners out there waiting to work with the NHS but they can't and then going forward um any examples of how we can
01:43:30.639 navigate that. So yeah I can come to that. So I think
01:43:36.239 devolution helps with some of this. It's very much a stasis at a national level. But for example, one of the companies
01:43:42.639 that was mentioned earlier on um Sir James' slides has been helped by both the Hinn and West combined authority to
01:43:50.239 make sure that they can continue on their development of their products. So I think more devolution can help with
01:43:57.040 sometimes some of the stasis that we're seeing at a national level at the moment.
01:44:03.040 I mean we do need to be honest that people are very distracted at the moment and um uh all of our a lot of our we had
01:44:10.159 our board meeting yesterday some colleagues from industry came to to be with us yesterday to see that you'd have heard us talking about our shortterm
01:44:16.719 priorities v our long-term priorities I don't think it's quite right to say that innovation has stopped completely and in
01:44:23.760 fact all of if anything we're doing more innovation now than I think we ever have done particularly with the the
01:44:29.199 investment we've had into the region the focus around chronic kidney disease um
01:44:34.719 uh um heart health as well and um women's tech but we are getting far more
01:44:39.920 focused and specific about what our what our priorities are um and I think for us
01:44:45.920 it's been about drawing on the capacity of the health innovation network who are totally integrated into um our
01:44:52.800 functioning as an integrated care board so that um where our commissioners are focused on driving efficiencies um and
01:45:00.080 some more operational demands particularly that these winter months bring them that we're not standing still
01:45:05.679 on innovation. So we are still very much open for business and we we we're just putting in place a joint post with our
01:45:11.760 combined authorities as well to drive this and probably one of the most exciting areas of innovation for us in
01:45:17.760 the north and we've got the three national health and growth accelerator sites um in West Yorkshire, South
01:45:24.320 Yorkshire and Northeast North Cumbria. Um, we've had 90 million pounds inward investment to help us um, uh, reduce the
01:45:32.560 number of people at risk of losing their employment and we're doing loads of innovation in that space because it's a
01:45:38.239 big test and learn environment. Um, we've got to demonstrate impact and I really hope that we can do um, but we're
01:45:44.320 doing lots of innovation in that space at the moment. Um, well, I'm af I'm afraid we are out of time unfortunately. That went uh,
01:45:52.000 super fast, but thank you so much. I mean what what a great and enriching conversation. Thank you all for your uh
01:45:57.760 insights and contributions. Uh I think it's clear NHS and industry partnerships
01:46:03.199 are absolutely mission critical and uh long may that continue here in the north. So uh give our panel a round of
01:46:09.679 applause. Thank you.
02:11:45.280 So, welcome back. Um, this is the panel on the future of health and digital. So,
02:11:51.199 I'm personally very excited as I have digital in my job title. My name is Laura Boyd and I'm director of digital
02:11:57.360 partnerships at Health Innovation Yorkshire and Humber. Um, we've got a
02:12:02.480 fantastic panel. Um, and I'll ask them to introduce themselves uh shortly. Um but just a quick reminder of why I think
02:12:08.960 this panel um is so key. We know digital runs through um the 10-year plan. Um
02:12:14.159 Jim's talk this morning really reminded us of, as he described it, the clunkiness of the NHS in the terms of
02:12:20.079 the way we invite people into physical appointments. We send them physical letters and a reminder of how people
02:12:25.199 manage their lives digitally um in in in other aspects of life. And Sam talked about um online banking. Um, however, I
02:12:33.760 think we'd be a miss um to have a digital panel and not talk about AI. So, apologies to those of you who who've
02:12:40.239 already kind of had enough of hearing about it, but the opportunity I think cannot be missed. There's a few reasons
02:12:46.000 for that. So, within the last year, just to highlight three publications, one was the uh Sudler review which really talked
02:12:52.639 about data and the moral imperative to use the data that we collect on people to improve patient outcomes. Uh the
02:12:59.040 government's AI uh transformation uh plan again sets out the role of AI
02:13:04.400 both in our economy um in productivity, creating jobs um and supporting our
02:13:09.840 health. And of course um the 10-year plan has AI running right through the heart of it from everything from back
02:13:16.079 office productivity to ambient voice technology to diagnostics uh to risk
02:13:21.119 prediction uh to supporting people to self-manage. So we've got lots and lots to cover today. Um I'm going to ask each
02:13:28.639 of the panel to introduce themselves um and to say a bit about what they're working on. I've got some questions but
02:13:34.400 there will be a chance for you to all ask questions. So please do have them ready. So Nisha, can I come to you
02:13:40.159 first? Okay. So I'm Nisha Sharma. I'm a consultant breast radiologist and director of the breast screening program
02:13:46.719 for leads and Wakefield. So I've not had to travel far for this meeting thankfully. Um but um so I'm a clinician
02:13:54.239 full-time uh but I'm also an innovator so I'm keen to adopt technologies and
02:14:00.880 also work with artificial intelligence that's going to improve the patient pathway. So I'm really in the thick of
02:14:07.360 it in terms of the pressures we're not meeting twoe targets when it comes to
02:14:12.960 women going to symptomatic breast service. I'm also working in the breast screening program which was developed in
02:14:18.960 1988. So I'm aware of dated pathways. I'm
02:14:24.560 aware of dated software. And what my role is is really to promote earlier
02:14:29.599 diagnosis and how can I improve the patient pathway but also improve the
02:14:34.639 pathway for the clinicians delivering the service because what we've got to remember is we've got to also help them
02:14:41.199 because we've got a workforce crisis. So in terms of artificial intelligence, I'm looking at um image quality. I'm looking
02:14:48.239 at the diagnostic setting. I'm looking at AI in the ultrasound setting and breast density. So, I'm working in
02:14:54.880 different areas within the breast field. Jacob,
02:14:59.920 morning everyone. Got that wrong. Afternoon. Uh, delighted to be here. Jacob West. I
02:15:06.560 look after Microsoft's healthcare and life sciences business in the UK. Uh, prior lives, uh, NHS policy maker, uh,
02:15:13.280 frontline hospital manager, medical research. Um, I've been at Microsoft nearly 5 years. It is all about AI now.
02:15:19.920 So if you wanted an apology, you're not going to get one from me. Sorry. Um but our our wider business really is about
02:15:25.679 AI solutions. It's about cloud data and AI platforms and it's about making that all secure. Um and I will talk about
02:15:31.760 co-pilot among other things. But I will hand over to Imam in the meantime. Hello. Um IM Hawk. I'm a co-founder at a
02:15:39.119 company called Quantexa. We are a Londonbased software firm offices in Liverpool and all around the world. So
02:15:46.560 just under a thousand or so people and we're focused on AI and big data and
02:15:51.679 connecting data to enable your AI. So we work with 30 of the 50 largest banks in
02:15:57.199 the world across the globe. um large government departments and what we tend to do is things like single view of
02:16:03.920 customers for the banks, the analytics platforms, the AI that sits on top of that, letting people talk to their data
02:16:10.639 which you can now do with AI and uh within government things like single um
02:16:16.320 tax record for citizens and businesses and things like that. So joining up very large amounts of data um AI, it's been
02:16:23.679 around a long time. I've been doing AI projects for a long time. In actual fact, I did my masters in AI in 1990 at
02:16:30.560 Northwestern. So that is a very long time ago. Um, so it's moved on a lot
02:16:35.760 since then. And I think the key is all about working in partnership to unlock
02:16:40.879 how you can use these things because we have a lot of skills and our customers, you know, want to work with us and
02:16:46.478 understand how they can transfer those skills from other sectors um to achieve the outcomes they'd like to achieve.
02:16:54.718 Hi everyone, I'm Don Grees. I'm associate director of digital transformation at Leeds Community Healthcare. Again, haven't traveled very
02:17:01.200 far. Um 15 minutes journey this morning, luckily. Um I'm here um I'm passionate
02:17:06.879 about digital transformation. I've worked in the NHS for 33 years now, 25 years in the N uh in digital
02:17:13.120 transformation. There's been many changes over those years. There's been many buzzwords. I'm wondering whether AI
02:17:19.760 is a buzzword or actually whether it's going to make some difference. So, I'm sat on the fence a little bit at the minute, but hopefully I'll share my
02:17:25.920 thoughts as we move forward. Um, from a community health care perspective, I think we've felt a little bit like the
02:17:32.718 poor relations in the system up to now with the three shifts in the um plan around hospital to uh home care um
02:17:42.160 analog to digital feels like from my perspective my time is now. Lots of opportunities now. If we can't do it
02:17:48.400 now, when will it happen? So, very excited. Thanks. um going to do a panel of two halves.
02:17:54.879 The first is going to focus on the what and the why. So what is it and why why are we doing this and then a second a
02:18:00.160 bit on on how do we get this implemented. So first question for Nisha really as as we've said you know digital
02:18:06.638 data really runs through the heart of the 10-year plan but from a patient and a staff perspective and we did have a
02:18:12.320 chat about the pressures on staff um just before we came in. What could it really mean? What what what you know
02:18:17.519 what transformation could we see? Um, I mean, I think it's good that it's in the 10-year plan, but for me, it's about
02:18:24.240 creating efficiencies and data, um, communicating data from different
02:18:30.160 registries, being able to have that data flow that can come to the clinicians, but then is also available to the
02:18:36.959 patients. I mean, at the moment, we we talk about us working in silos, but the
02:18:42.400 data systems seem to be working in silo as well. So you you have a national registry where you can record a woman's
02:18:49.120 ethnicity, but we have to ask them their ethnicity when they come for breast screening because we don't have
02:18:55.040 permission to use that information. So you know, so we're there's a lot of
02:19:00.400 repetition of data collection. There's inefficiency and if data isn't readily available to us, then how do we know
02:19:07.440 we're making the correct decisions for the patient? And if the patient doesn't have all the information or their family
02:19:14.080 then how do they know what choices that they have available to them and make the right decisions and decide where they
02:19:20.478 want to go. So knowledge is power and it gives us empowerment as clinicians but
02:19:25.920 also for the patients and their families to be empowered and restore I think confidence within the health service
02:19:32.959 because often you'll you'll hear it the patients will say don't you know that already
02:19:39.599 and then it's awful because you've got to say well we don't have that information available to us or we're not allowed to see that information. So I
02:19:46.638 think that flow of information I think would be really important. But for me it's about the registries communicating
02:19:51.920 with one another so that we have one patient record that's complete and
02:19:57.600 therefore we create safe delivery of health care and that will drive up confidence within uh the system as well.
02:20:05.120 But the the other part for me is about um we touched on it this morning and we
02:20:10.960 talked about um innovation and how do we share good innovation um and I think
02:20:16.560 that is lacking because you know I am doing innovation in my department but to
02:20:22.000 get it to scale it is going to be a challenge because how do I get
02:20:28.080 visibility of the work that I've done how do I get adoptability from different organizations and how do we recognize
02:20:35.200 that that's good clinical practice because um we've got good algorithms out
02:20:41.359 there. We know that they work, but what we've got is um a lack of adoption,
02:20:48.160 willingness to adopt because we're risk averse. And what we need to do is start thinking
02:20:54.800 differently. And the other thing that I'd just like to add is the the problem with innovation is we have a pathway.
02:21:01.760 And we've just been told that the processes we've been using have been there since 1948. And for the breast
02:21:07.520 screening program, it's been there since 1988. But what do we do when we get innovation? We adapt it into the same
02:21:13.920 pathway. We don't actually think could we do this differently. So actually
02:21:19.760 let's scrap the current pathway and now that we've got all these new technologies, all these new innovations,
02:21:25.280 could we work differently? And that's why I think adoption is failing at pace
02:21:31.120 because we're trying to just keep going the way we are and no one's got the head space to think laterally.
02:21:38.240 Thanks Nisha. Um two things you I just want to pick up on. One is around that efficiencies piece and this is crazy.
02:21:44.319 You know we share data we create more efficiencies. If we can spread innovation that piece into the productivity agenda, doesn't it? We're
02:21:50.720 being more productive. So Jacob to your point um tenure plans it mentions
02:21:55.760 productivity 61 times. Could you talk a bit about um what you're doing at Microsoft on productivity and one of the
02:22:02.800 things um we talked about in our preme wasn't it? Well what does productivity actually mean? So it' be great to kind of yeah have have a few thoughts on
02:22:09.040 that. Of course. Thanks Laura. So uh three AI
02:22:14.160 applications that are here and now that are productivity enhancing and one that's in the post. Uh so number one
02:22:19.760 copilot. Anyone heard of Cop-ilot? Yeah. Anyone using it? Uh, okay. Quite a few hands. So, there are tens of thousands
02:22:25.920 of people in the NHS using Copilot. Hopefully, you are already seeing some value from that. NHS England's uh
02:22:32.319 evaluation study of 10,000 users says that it saves 43 minutes per user per day. That's two days a month. Uh, that's
02:22:40.000 nearly a month a year. That is a lot of productivity to give back to the NHS. How do you turn that into a cashable
02:22:45.760 saving? That's for brighter minds than me to work out. But the opportunity is there. Um and that that is just the out
02:22:52.399 of the box technology where that goes next. The kind of use cases that gets applied to that are clinically adjacent.
02:22:57.760 It's not for direct clinical care I think are really exciting. So that's the first one. The second one is dragon
02:23:03.280 copilot which we launched in the market um this month. Sorry it's 1 of October last month September. That is um
02:23:10.800 Microsoft's clinical AI assistant. Um it's not just ambient voice technology. It's a whole workflow. Uh on average
02:23:17.680 that saves five minutes per clinical encounter. Um that would be about if every GP used that uh co-pilot told me
02:23:23.760 this morning that would be over 500,000 hours per week back to the NHS. Um it
02:23:29.439 won't be appropriate for every of the every one of the 140 million outpatient appointments, but it will be appropriate
02:23:36.160 for a large proportion of those. Think about that productivity opportunity. And that isn't just about um it's in part
02:23:43.280 about clinical u burnout or the avoidance of it. It's also about patient quality. How does the patient tell a
02:23:49.520 fuller story, eyes on the clinician? Um so it's technology in a way that takes away technology and enhances the patient
02:23:56.319 experience as well as increasing the efficiency of the service. So we're really excited about that. We've been triing that technology with a number of
02:24:03.680 trusts including Manchester Foundation Trust and looking to see how that starts to scale in the NHS. The third one is is
02:24:11.520 agents. Uh we are in the living in the agentic era. So Satia our global CEO
02:24:16.960 tells us that is about so co-pilot is about personal productivity. If dragon copilot is about clinical productivity,
02:24:22.720 agents are about automating processes. So how do you cut the drudgery from processes that don't need to be manual?
02:24:28.720 So one example that's already real in Blackpool they are using an HR agent to turn a manual HR conversation a manual
02:24:36.399 HR process that would take 10 pounds about 10 to 15 minutes per encounter to something would cost about 50 p. Uh if
02:24:42.960 you start to scale that up you start to think about the productivity opportunity across a whole series of functional areas. Um so those three are here and
02:24:50.080 now happening productivity enhancing in the NHS. Uh the one in the post that I think is maybe even more exciting is is
02:24:56.960 if you start to put this technology in the hands of consumers in our hands as patients we you know we've all we've all
02:25:03.840 um you know back in the days of WebMD or Google search you know people have started to inform themselves uh you know
02:25:10.000 as a patient but generative AI with that you know low barrier to entry that insane computing power that sits beneath
02:25:16.399 it uh starts to take it to another level. There is a big regulatory question that needs to be addressed there. uh but Microsoft AI based out of
02:25:23.600 London is developing that kind of tooling and thinking about what could that mean to really I think completely
02:25:29.120 shift the supply and demand curve um or the supply and demand equation uh in
02:25:34.479 healthcare so it's very exciting I think where that might go uh but that's a little uh further down I I think so
02:25:40.160 hopefully that gave some um uh some some ideas happy to carry on the conversation thank you um IM context
02:25:48.319 works across multiple sectors so lots for us to learn from different industries. Can you talk about some of
02:25:53.840 the kind of the wider work you've been involved in and what we can take away and bring into the NHS? Sure. So, if I look across whatever I've
02:26:00.880 been doing across all these sectors, I think there's one theme that's pretty common. Everyone is very datari but
02:26:06.640 informationelligence poor. So, what that means is they have armies of data
02:26:12.399 scientists and others trying to bring the data together trying to get some insight out of it so they can make
02:26:18.000 better decisions. that's fundamentally what they're trying to do whether you're a bank, an insurer, a tax department,
02:26:23.520 whatever it might be. So the question is how can you reduce the effort involved
02:26:29.120 in that? And that's the work we've been doing across all of these different sectors. So um AI's been around a long
02:26:35.680 time but the critical element is getting context in that underlying data. You
02:26:41.040 can't just look at one piece of data in isolation and say I can make a decision. You know in a bank it might be is this
02:26:46.800 transaction money laundering? you've no idea. You've got to know where's it going from, where's it going to, what
02:26:52.399 are those companies, who are those directors, what they they might be connected to. So if you can build the
02:26:58.160 context which for which you have to solve a very hard problem which is a single view of the person or the
02:27:03.520 business, not everyone has an NHS number in all the data that's relevant. So you
02:27:09.760 know schooling data, social care data may be interesting, might not have an
02:27:14.960 NHS number. So join the data up and then you can start using the analytical
02:27:20.880 capabilities. Now as we've just heard the latest round of AI is doing
02:27:26.720 something which is empowering people to literally talk to their data and that's
02:27:31.760 what we've been providing to these large organizations. You can just ask questions of your data. You don't have
02:27:37.120 to go to a data scientist request the data get a bunch of work done and then you can take that further because the
02:27:43.520 data can start alerting you. Is there a problem here? Is there a hot spot here? So that's been a key um understanding
02:27:51.520 within those sectors. Now how does that translate into health care? We're currently doing a pilot at Cheshire Mury
02:27:58.240 side which is all around vulnerable children. So if a child goes into A&E,
02:28:03.359 they might have a broken arm. They may be in another A&E two weeks later with bruising. Is there an underlying issue?
02:28:10.479 So if you could generate context in the data by joining up social care, mental
02:28:15.920 health, community data, you may understand the household risks involved,
02:28:21.280 whether there's, I don't know, some sort of domestic violence, alcoholism, or whatever it might be in that context so
02:28:28.000 that the person that's treating the child at that point can immediately see what's going on. And that's where the
02:28:34.080 data is allowing you to get a full picture very quickly. And there's many many scenarios around joining up primary
02:28:41.359 care, secondary care and other types of data. So the next phases of that project in an ideal world you will get education
02:28:48.960 data, you would get more data from people like policing and others that is relevant to that. So we have to unlock
02:28:55.680 that and really the the AI and the capability that sits on top of this context is what lets people make better
02:29:03.120 decisions faster with less effort. And that's probably the key lesson that I've
02:29:09.200 seen. Obviously, there's lots of other things in AI as there's all the uh radiography, image processing, etc. But
02:29:15.920 underlying data gives you a huge amount of value if you can join it up. Fantastic. Thank you. I'm really glad
02:29:22.399 you picked up um context and what that data tells us about individuals and what it means because that segus nicely into
02:29:29.040 um the question we're going to ask Dawn, which is around community. Community is where life happens, isn't it? It's where we intersect with kind of home um and
02:29:35.359 health. Um and you know with neighborhoods and community really highlighted in the tenure plan, could you say a little bit
02:29:42.000 about what it what what can it mean? What are the opportunities in a often neglected part of the NHS?
02:29:48.479 So I want to tell you a little bit about our home first approach that we've got going on across the lead city. So it's a
02:29:53.840 single piece of work happening across all the partners in leads. We started this over two years ago. So it's not a
02:29:59.280 new thing that's come as part of the 10-year plan. It's already a priority that we knew we had to focus on. So um
02:30:05.760 as part of that work physically what it meant is bringing people into a single room to work together. So we have social
02:30:13.200 care teams, community teams based in the hospital looking at how we can get those
02:30:18.319 people out of bed back into their own home to recover well. That's the aim of what we want to do. Get people out as
02:30:24.240 early as possible. So physically we've been doing that work for quite some time but it was a pilot. You know we don't
02:30:30.640 like pilots. Where are we taking it next? we needed to think about what are the enabling functions that will allow
02:30:35.680 us to scale that out across the whole city. So one of the things that came out of that was the need for a single care
02:30:41.439 plan. So it doesn't matter who's treating that person, who's delivering the care, we're going to have one care
02:30:47.920 plan. So everybody kn knows what's going on. So I was brought into BSRO for that
02:30:53.280 work and we just went live in May with a single care plan. So we believe it's one of the first ones across the whole
02:30:58.560 country to bring social care and community services together to work on a single system. Don't quote me on that.
02:31:05.840 Um but what that's done is it allowed us to implement a single triage model. So
02:31:11.040 we're doing one triage rather than two separate ones. It's happening quicker. So we know that the patients getting the
02:31:16.800 right level of care first time, not having to go out multiple visits. We've got the right level of people going out
02:31:22.960 to treat them so we've not got wasted visits as well. So it's made the whole system really much more efficient. The
02:31:29.120 people that are going out into the homes have got all the information that they need because it's in that single care plan. So it's more efficient from a
02:31:35.520 clinician's perspective. Patients aren't having to regurgitate the information over and over again. But where we were
02:31:42.240 previously is community had their own system. Social care were writing on paper in someone's house. So that
02:31:49.680 information isn't going anywhere. It's always there. But it's not easy to digest in that format when you're used
02:31:54.960 to working digitally. Um but bringing the social care teams on that journey
02:32:00.560 was a challenge. So they didn't have devices. A lot of them didn't have the skills to use the device even if we were
02:32:06.240 to give them one. The EPR that we use in community is not the easiest system to learn. It's not intuitive. So we had to
02:32:13.439 spend a lot of time bringing those 150 staff on board with using technology,
02:32:18.960 owning a device. What does that mean? How do I charge it? How do I make sure I've got connectivity uh before I've
02:32:24.640 even got into the uh care plan. So, a whole um journey of that we've been
02:32:30.000 through to get to this point. Um we didn't get the training right either. So, I think we thought e-learning was
02:32:36.560 going to be great. Everybody doesn't learn that way. So, we're now having to revisit quite a bit um since we've gone
02:32:42.479 live. The uh go live support was intense, much more than we thought we'd have to do because these people aren't
02:32:48.800 based in an office. you can't you can't just place someone to offer support to these people. You've got to think about
02:32:54.160 other ways of doing that. So it we've learned a lot um but we are now scaling that out to other other areas of the
02:33:00.240 city. So it is bringing us some real good impact. Now that's not innovation. It's doing something better with what
02:33:06.880 we've already got. But how could we transform that journey with AI on top?
02:33:12.080 Um so I was I was at an event last week where um there was a gentleman from social care talking about connected
02:33:18.160 care. what difference could it make if we had better connected data like uh we've just spoke about and I heard a use
02:33:25.040 case around uh a gentleman with Down syndrome always lived with his parents but wanted to be independent so just
02:33:31.600 recently moved into shared accommodation with some other young teenagers that were learning together. He had a history
02:33:38.560 of uh setting fires. Social care knew that had it recorded as a flag on their
02:33:43.680 system but no other partners knew about that. So at the point where he sets his house on fire, it raised a big big alarm
02:33:50.640 bells. Had the fire brigade known that was an issue, they could have put some precautions in place of thinking about that preventative method. We're just not
02:33:57.840 there in terms of connected care. So whilst we talk a lot about health and care and bringing that together, it's
02:34:03.040 not just those two partners. It's the whole system that need connecting up. So we work a lot with third sector
02:34:08.399 organizations across leads, but we don't have their data and they don't have ours. They don't know what's going on.
02:34:14.319 But the system could be so much better. Is that connected data or is it AI? What could AI offer on top of that to make it
02:34:21.520 more efficient? There's much more around how do we prevent some of these things that we know we know is going to happen.
02:34:27.520 We're also looking at a tech enabled care model across leads. So at the moment you could be in hospital, go home
02:34:33.120 on a virtual ward with a set of technology so we can monitor you to see what's happening. Social care might have
02:34:39.439 given you some technology because it's part of your normal preventative measures. And in community care, we are
02:34:45.200 also starting to think about virtual wards. Three pieces of technology someone might interact with in a short
02:34:51.040 space of time. How do they understand how to use it? Who do they speak to when there's a problem with it? The whole
02:34:56.960 system is flawed to start with. So we're looking at if we had one central database of what materials are
02:35:03.120 available, what technology people might need. Give them it once. give them one contact center but as long as all the
02:35:09.760 partners that are interacting with them can see that data that's where we need to be so we're just going to start a pilot in falls prevention so it's early
02:35:17.200 days but real opportunities I think from an AI perspective some of that technology is going to be really uh
02:35:22.880 important for what we need to do and drive those efficiencies across the system so not just for health for every
02:35:28.240 everybody thank you so much um all really compelling cases or opportunities for
02:35:35.840 how we can use dig and AI. Um, but we know tech and the digital pieces are
02:35:40.880 just one part of the solution, aren't they? We really want to understand how do we how do we implement them? How do we get them taken up and sustained and
02:35:47.040 rolled out? So, I guess the next kind of question set really is around what are the conditions for us being able to
02:35:52.479 really optimize and make the most of digital and the AI opportunities that present themselves. So, in no particular
02:35:59.040 order, would anyone like to kind of just kind of talk about what needs to be in place? What are the enablers that enable this?
02:36:04.240 Yeah, I think um I have like a bit of a mantra which has always worked well on projects I've done which is innovate,
02:36:11.120 pilot and adopt. Sounds simple, but there's a lot of traps along the way if you don't get it right. The right way to
02:36:18.000 do it is to find the innovator. So I can give you a I could give you loads of example. I'll give you one example which
02:36:24.240 is roll on rolloff feries. So the task there is trucks turn up at Calala. You
02:36:29.520 have half an hour to work out which truck do you stop at do. Could be conbban, could be drugs, could be human
02:36:35.040 trafficking, whatever it might be. And we put an AI system in. This is 20 years ago. And statistically it was a probably
02:36:42.319 a bit better than how the inspectors were doing their guess work. But do you think it ever got adopted? No. So what
02:36:48.880 we did was then went back and got the innovator who we were then going to amplify out to all of his colleagues. So
02:36:56.319 he worked with us and told us what to do, which sorts of models, because everyone thinks AI is going to work it
02:37:01.520 out for itself. It won't. There's 101 things that you guys out here all know
02:37:07.040 that AI will never learn on its own. So you need to help it. So AI is there to
02:37:12.880 amplify and take what you do and repeat it. So this guy gave us all the different scenarios. is he said, "Oh, if
02:37:18.640 a truck goes across and a foot passenger goes across at the same time, he's a tourist and it happens again and again,
02:37:24.399 stop the truck." And we said, "Well, why would we do that?" So, it mean that foot passenger is a minder. It means there's
02:37:29.920 drugs on the truck. So, these insights don't come from AI itself, but then we
02:37:35.359 could do stuff that people can't do quickly. We could scan all the company's house records, see which C logistics
02:37:41.520 firms had previously had their husband or wife have a company where there were contraband stock. So this type of
02:37:49.200 capability and getting that innovator to then go out to all of his colleagues and say his system's going to be great. You
02:37:55.680 should adopt it. It's really going to work well because he was involved with it. So innovators help adoption and
02:38:04.399 piloting is the way you prove the point or the business case and that time and time again whether it's banks, tax
02:38:10.399 authorities, border control, whatever it is, that's the way projects get successful.
02:38:16.800 Thank you. Well, I was I was going to say I I think this is quite an exciting time for us in terms of adopting new
02:38:23.439 innovations and artificial intelligence within the NHS because it might mean that we'll all have better IT systems
02:38:30.160 and infrastructures in place because currently we're not all at the same
02:38:35.280 benchmark. So even if a company was to come to us and we were to deploy an algorithm, you'd probably find that
02:38:42.479 you're not in the right version of the the pack system. If you're using imaging, you might not be on the right
02:38:48.160 version for Windows. Um, you know, so the thing is our basics are not there
02:38:54.240 and the assumption is that we're all working at the same level and we're not. So I think innovation might allow us at
02:39:02.800 speed to get to the same level. Um so I think we should embrace that and not see
02:39:08.000 that as a negativity because um if people feel that this is a priority they
02:39:14.800 will invest and so that could be investment in our IT infrastructure. So I think I think that's really important.
02:39:22.080 Um and the second thing is I think I think we have to challenge now if I go back to the breast screening program we
02:39:28.800 have national breast screening system which was developed in 1988. It's been agreed that it needs to be
02:39:34.720 modernized and I've been waiting for 15 years for it to be modernized and I've now got a time scale of another five
02:39:41.359 years. And my question is why? Because when pandemic hit overnight we went to having
02:39:50.800 to have face-toface meetings to be able to doing everything online and virtually and we were able to create that
02:39:56.560 connectivity. So I I do feel that this is our opportunity now to challenge and
02:40:03.359 ask why when the technology exists is it taking so long for it to be delivered
02:40:09.920 where we need it in the front line you know and it's really exciting to hear about intelligent use of AI looking at
02:40:17.200 data and collecting it and what we've been doing in leads but my question is why aren't we speaking to companies that
02:40:22.800 have that software in place that could actually help us get there much quicker So instead of doing a six month or one
02:40:29.520 year or 18month pilot, why aren't we going out speaking to companies who have that technology say this is what we want
02:40:36.240 to do? Can we actually do it within three months? Excellent. Thank you. I think that's a
02:40:41.359 great call to action, isn't it? You know, if we can see things are working, why aren't we being more demanding of the system? Thank you. Who else?
02:40:47.680 Um, thanks. I love I love that Nisha. I think
02:40:52.880 just to reinforce in an example that you alluded to. So let's not beat ourselves up. The NHS can uh adopt technology very
02:40:59.840 rapidly under conditions maybe of expediency. The sort of roll out of teams in the early weeks of the pandemic
02:41:05.600 is a is a terrific example of that. And now it's ubiquitous. Um and if you've got a problem with your teams, talk to
02:41:11.439 me afterwards or or don't. Um but I think the in the era of AI we have both
02:41:17.840 new opportunities to think about technology adoption and some new challenges I suppose. So um just maybe
02:41:24.399 to reinforce another point Nisha made you the often the argument goes well I I
02:41:30.960 can't implement AI because I haven't got the basics right. Well, turn that round like get get your organization AI ready
02:41:37.040 and sometimes that will be the way in which you can convince you know the CEO or the CFO that they need to invest into
02:41:42.960 into some basic infrastructure uh as opposed to arguing it for its own terms or because it's a cyber security risk
02:41:49.359 unfortunately. Um so that that's one I think domain area. The second area where there's some new challenges is around uh
02:41:55.840 trust and governance. So you know AI can be a black box. um it it it it benefits
02:42:02.479 from explanability. Um Microsoft have introduced something called the responsible AI uh approach with an AI
02:42:09.439 dashboard that helps do exactly that. So we've done work with organizations like North Umbrea on their predictive AI risk
02:42:15.920 score for orthopedic surgery that help uh clinicians explain to patients what that technology means in practice. And
02:42:23.600 then in terms of adoption, you know, adoption can't be top down or just bottom up. It's got to be sort of
02:42:28.800 multifaceted and some of the best uh um the most effective ways in which we're
02:42:34.000 seeing AI being adopted is peer-to-peer learning, peer-to-peer sharing. So, we're running things called co-pilot
02:42:39.200 cafes which get are getting sort of a thousand plus attendees across the NHS. And because this is a new technology,
02:42:45.359 it's actually users at the bleeding edge of this talking to other users about, you know, the prompts they're using or
02:42:51.439 the the use cases that are most valuable to them that is really driving adoption. And frankly, when you hear people
02:42:56.960 saying, you know, never take this technology away from me, you know that that this is an adoption curve that's going to grow and grow.
02:43:03.439 Thank you. And bringing it down a tone probably. Um, we talked earlier about risk
02:43:10.160 appetite. The NHS is is not great from that perspective. So, I think there's something about how we do it safely. We
02:43:17.439 keep hearing we can't use these technologies for clinical content, for confidential content, but we need to
02:43:23.760 change that model. It's got to work for that. That's where the efficiencies are going to come. I think it's also something about how we understand what
02:43:29.680 are the use cases that really are going to benefit from this. We did some work across our trust engaging with every
02:43:35.200 single service to find out who would want to use ambient voice technology just that nothing else. They all wanted
02:43:42.240 it. But when you look at their processes, it won't work. The EPR system that we use is not set up to work that
02:43:48.240 way. There's lots of tick boxes, checklists. it won't work or it won't bring them the efficiencies that they
02:43:53.680 that they're expecting. So we need to enable people to understand what the
02:43:59.200 tools are going to offer, what benefits they're going to get in different contexts. I think when you look at a lot of the innovations that come out,
02:44:05.840 they're quite focused on acute care because pressure points are are in the
02:44:11.120 hospitals, but unless we get the community services right, the pressure points are always going to be in the hospitals. though we do need to think
02:44:17.120 about what technology works in community services to help patients um be better
02:44:23.279 and I think that's the landscape just needs to change. I think uh we need to get more people thinking about community
02:44:29.200 services and what the opportunities are that are there. I think it's a real untapped market at the moment. Hint
02:44:34.960 hint. Excellent. Thank you. So I'm going to turn to the audience now. It's your opportunity to ask some questions. We
02:44:42.240 have got a microphone so please raise hand. the lady there. Micros coming.
02:44:49.520 Thank you very much. I just wanted to pick up on Nisha's point in the sense that you've waited so long for some technology and then you've got to you've
02:44:56.000 now been told you've got to wait another five years and what's the barrier to adoption? I wonder whether some of the
02:45:01.279 barrier to adoption actually is not the clinicians or the the staff that are working with the patients. It's actually
02:45:07.120 the IT teams within the within the hospitals and the networks. I'm from
02:45:14.240 industry and we often find actually they're the blockers to be able for us to move things forward because to your
02:45:20.640 point they're very risk averse. How can we break that down and get the IT
02:45:25.760 departments and IT infrastructure that you've got to understand how important it is and to work with industry to a
02:45:33.040 enable us to help you. And so I mean I I think that that's a
02:45:40.080 very valid point and I think one of the problems that you you face within the the trust is the governance side of
02:45:46.240 things. I think if your information governance and data protection team understand the what the ask is from a
02:45:54.080 clinical perspective they can often say that this is doable. Um but it's often
02:46:00.240 it's the people that don't have the knowledge that end up being the barriers because they're risk averse. Um, and
02:46:06.960 often what what I found with the AI work that I've done, I've had to knock on
02:46:12.640 lots of doors to eventually find the right people that actually understand what I'm trying to do instead of the
02:46:19.359 knee-jerk response saying, "No, that's too difficult." And and as a result, I found those enablers within my own
02:46:26.080 organization where I can set up projects within months rather than years because
02:46:32.640 I know the right people to speak to. And also um I think you make assumptions
02:46:38.720 that people understand and we have to stop making those assumptions. If people if you can't get your point across,
02:46:45.680 you're obviously using language that they don't understand or they don't understand
02:46:51.520 clinically why it's relevant. So you have to change your narrative for them to understand why this is important for
02:46:57.760 the clinicians or for the patients or for the service as a whole. So I've learned that over a period of time. But
02:47:05.359 um but you do have to knock on lots of doors. But the other apart from it being at a local level, I think at a national
02:47:12.319 level, there's a lack of expertise as well. And there may not be enough people
02:47:17.359 working on the projects to be able to deliver at pace. And we've also seen a turnover of staff. So often you'll find
02:47:24.479 that you've worked with somebody at the beginning of the year and by the end of the year they've moved on and you're working with somebody new. So the the
02:47:31.760 problem with the national breast screening system is the DTOS that's at a national level and not at a local level.
02:47:38.720 So I think there are m multiple barriers at different levels. Um so it's not just
02:47:44.880 at the trust level. I think nationally there are barriers for deployment and um
02:47:50.479 speed of adoption which I think we need to rectify because I do think there's a big disconnect. the vision of AI and
02:47:58.080 health care, we all get that is our future, but they're not realizing there's a black hole in the middle. Um,
02:48:05.200 and we need to fill that gap for success. If I can just come in on that one as
02:48:10.960 well. I think um there's so many standards we've got to follow in the NHS. It's a minefield. I was speaking to
02:48:16.800 a tech innovator last week and who'd said it' taken him 18 months just to get through the NHS process of digital
02:48:22.800 safety. That's something we need. So as innovators it's almost how do you get through that as quickly as possible
02:48:29.359 coming to us with that completed the risk is not as high um but it's how do
02:48:34.479 we make that process easier for you guys and that can only come from from national it's not an organizational
02:48:41.200 level I think um re quite recently on the ambient voice technology lots of organizations have started triing
02:48:47.279 different product and then NHS England gave us a mandate to say you can only use ones that meet the DTAC standards I
02:48:53.200 think it left us with one Um, you know, we've got to make sure that we're following those standards, but making it
02:48:58.399 easier for organizations, I think. Excellent. We've got time for one more question.
02:49:05.439 Now for time, gentlemen here. It's more of an observation.
02:49:10.479 So, Pierce from North Charity working across the region. And I think there's
02:49:17.760 what I'm hearing today is an awful lot of work that's happening kind of in the innovation.
02:49:23.040 There's a lot of work that's happening in the innovation um space linking in with the NHS. Um but when we talk um and
02:49:29.359 Dawn just made a really good point about you know taking things out into the community the third sector do an awful
02:49:34.800 lot of work and do an awful lot of services uh across the community and work with the NHS and really really
02:49:41.359 strong partnerships. Um it's just an observation and probably a plea really. I think we need to consider how we're
02:49:46.880 developing the capability of of that sector to be able to help in some of these areas as we move forward. So, um I
02:49:54.000 just it was just a sort of an observation, but I think you know there's a responsibility otherwise we're missing an opportunity that we will rely
02:50:00.240 on when we're trying to do the shift that everybody's talking about. Thank you. Does anyone want to respond
02:50:05.760 to I think that's a really good point and and obviously we work really closely with North Point. Got some great
02:50:11.359 partnerships there. They're delivering care on our behalf. they're a vital partner, but we have limited data
02:50:17.840 sharing between our organizations and that's part of the puzzle that we need to fix. Thanks for raising that is such an
02:50:24.000 important point. Thank you. That brings us to the end of the panel. So, a huge thank you um to our panelists.
02:50:36.640 I think we're happy about
02:50:49.760 One more session to go and I think possibly the most important session of the morning. Um so we're going to hear
02:50:56.319 um from our patient representative today. I'm delighted to introduce um Wendy Wendy Westby. She's going to um
02:51:02.880 tell us her story. Um, and that's a story that I think is a fascinating and very powerful story for us all to hear
02:51:09.200 and I think will reflect some of the opportunities and challenges um in our health service as we've discussed this
02:51:14.399 morning. Um, so with no further ado, have we got a microphone for Wendy?
02:51:20.000 Excellent. Could you all welcome Wendy to stage please? [Applause]
02:52:47.439 True to the agenda. I am Wendy Westby. Good. Good job. I'm here because I'm that's right on the agenda. I've lived
02:52:54.640 in the Red County for many years, but I think I was allowed through the country barrier due to being basically a
02:53:00.479 Southerner born and brought up in Kent. In 2009, I had a stroke and is not
02:53:07.200 unusual for stroke survivors. I have problems with words, so I'm going to have to use my notes. Sorry about that.
02:53:14.880 My story goes back to 1955 when as a teenager I call paralytic polomiolitis
02:53:23.760 with after a couple of years it left me with some lower back and leg weakness.
02:53:29.840 Jump forward then to 2000 when I started experiencing some problems with my heart rhythm. Sometimes just for a few
02:53:36.720 minutes, other times for up to 12 hours. I saw my GP who referred me to a
02:53:43.200 consultant cardiologist but the funny feeling never happened during any of those appointments. So I was just left
02:53:50.080 to get on with it. Over a cardia in those days a simple but
02:53:56.000 so efficient piece of technology. When I had the stroke in March 2009
02:54:02.720 again rightsided paralysis is where the polio connection slips in. No one had
02:54:08.399 any knowledge of polio or subsequent postpolio syndrome which meant it was
02:54:13.600 hard for anyone to set me targets because I had no details of the previous weakness and I wasn't in a position to
02:54:20.640 either work with the physio or set targets myself. I now recommend to all stroke patients
02:54:28.479 with any success, no no matter how small, they report it somehow either in
02:54:35.200 by to a friend, a relative, on a tape, on a on a computer, anywhere, just so
02:54:42.319 you can see what happens. Two occasions in particular come to my
02:54:47.520 mind. After a very long route to recovery, the very first time I was able to use a pair of secretars in my right
02:54:54.160 hand and the other the very first time I was able to flip an egg in the frying pan. May sound simple but so important.
02:55:03.439 Unfortunately, I'm still unable to write legibly after my stroke
02:55:08.640 or take the eyes out of new potatoes, although I can prepare most foods for Colin to cook.
02:55:15.200 Then during the third week in hospital after my stroke, the pulse symptoms returned. I tried to explain this was
02:55:22.000 okay and it would go in more than no more than 12 hours. Stupid female logic. I was diagnosed. It
02:55:29.840 was diagnosed as P AF. Whoops. I've lost my screen.
02:55:35.760 Just hang about. We'll get back to it.
02:55:52.800 and that's right back online.
02:55:58.399 It was diagnosed as AF and treatment started with Warin. It was subsequently suggested that the stroke might have
02:56:04.880 been AF induced as I mean all the right things going to the gym not particularly
02:56:10.720 overweight never smoked and drank within recommended limits.
02:56:16.240 The postpolio syndrome diagnosis meant that I had been advised by the PPS consultant in St. Thomas's London not to
02:56:23.439 take standard statins which were recommended at the time along with Warin.
02:56:29.439 My superb doctor, Michelle Kidd, looking after me at Warrington General, was good enough to take Colin's word for it, and
02:56:36.800 she found a suitable alternative.
02:56:43.520 Oh dear. Yeah.
02:56:50.720 Should have had a paper note, shouldn't I?
02:56:58.479 I'm going to be eroding into your lunchtime if I'm not careful.
02:57:09.200 Got there.
02:57:20.319 It's okay to cancel.
02:57:37.840 I was discharged in a wheelchair and unable to construct a sentence. I was again then referred to a different
02:57:44.399 cardiologist as I've been hospitalized outside my area. He suggested cardioversion which lasted less than 12
02:57:51.920 hours. So I was then referred to a specialist in heart rhythms but unfortunate unfortunately the waiting
02:57:58.960 lists everywhere were very long as I had medical insurance decided to become a private patient to visit Profupter at
02:58:05.920 Liverpool heart and chest who over the next few years did four catheter ablations each time when I lapsed out of
02:58:11.840 sinus. Unfortunately try again.
02:58:19.600 Unfortunately, I gain relapsed in the beginning of COVID and after a telephone conversation agreed with Profut not to
02:58:26.160 proceed with any more surgery and now cope just on medication.
02:58:31.760 In my first year of recovery, I was visited home by a student, Emma, now a doctor with whom I'm still in contact,
02:58:39.439 who was investigating how stroke survivors coped in the period after discharge.
02:58:44.800 The second month at home was the worst of the whole time. I'd be naively thinking once home in a comfortable bed,
02:58:51.600 having good access to good food and being able to use the L whenever I wanted
02:58:56.880 would I was going to be better. When that didn't help, when that didn't happen, I was really pretty desperate.
02:59:05.279 I spent hours crying in frustration.
02:59:12.240 I went to stroke association group meet weekly meeting which subsequently was forced to operate on a voluntary basis.
02:59:18.479 I became a volunteer to assist with the group was subsequently appointed a stroke ambassador for the region.
02:59:25.279 Unfortunately, the voluntary group then closed. Later, perhaps 2015, I received an email
02:59:32.880 addressed to all stroke ambassadors in the Northwest asking for anyone who's interested in AF and strokes to contact
02:59:39.680 a telephone number in Daresbury. I rang was invited to a meeting to discuss and
02:59:46.080 left this meeting as one of the first group of Debbie Parkinson's AF ambassadors with a cardia machine full
02:59:53.359 training on how to use it. Now I felt like I was starting on my quest to help others to perhaps avoid a stroke.
03:00:01.439 If you consider that the average figure is 5% of the adult population with undiagnosed AF, I've now treat I've now
03:00:09.760 tested over 2,500 people. So I reckon I've got quite a few
03:00:15.359 belts and things under my belt.
03:00:20.560 It's in my opinion it's essential that this service is protected and extended.
03:00:27.040 so useful. During this time, I was still experiencing occasional AF and having
03:00:34.319 access obviously to my cardia machine, I was able to forward a trace to my heart rhythm specialist from my holiday hotel
03:00:41.680 in Tenneref and get an appointment for the Friday after he returned home, which led to one
03:00:48.240 of the four cathlations. a true example of the power of technology to use to everyone's e
03:00:56.000 advantage. The highlight of this voluntary role was
03:01:02.399 the success of the project in the HSI awards in 2021, the collaboration category,
03:01:09.439 when I was honored to be invited to the formal evening in London. When we arrived, we were seated at a table many,
03:01:16.000 many yards away from David and Debbie. Debbie sent me a text message saying that if by any chance we were successful
03:01:23.680 that I should go on stage with them to receive the award from Sue Perkins. I admit I didn't take much notice apart
03:01:31.359 from thinking how to get my wheelchair from over there to the stage over there and then up there.
03:01:39.840 Especially as I had an accident just a couple of months earlier with my caravan and fractured my left femur. So the
03:01:47.040 right leg's dodgy. The right leg left us and so I'm still on sticks.
03:01:54.960 Anyway, we were very look fortunate. The announcement was made. We had one. Dave
03:02:00.720 and Debbie rushed from their table, took me by one arm each side, and dragged me up onto the stage.
03:02:14.240 Point to make here is the number of adults in the general public who have no idea how to check their own pulses.
03:02:20.399 Something we tend to talk to folk about after an AF test if there isn't a queue waiting.
03:02:26.399 We take the time until someone can locate their own pulse and know how to count it and report to GPS if bothered.
03:02:33.760 I wonder if it could be worthwhile printing information including statistics, put them in doctor's waiting
03:02:39.920 rooms, get people to just sit there and test their own pulse. After our success, it
03:02:47.439 was discussed how we could develop the role and it was decided that anyone who wished could con convert and train in a
03:02:54.000 new role as heart hero also able to check blood pressures. I was already
03:03:00.160 trained by the stroke association. So obviously changed from title and picked up a new t-shirt.
03:03:08.800 Additionally, I've been involved in research project run by HNWC on the subject of new technology BP machines.
03:03:15.600 This is in its early stages but hopefully will ultimately assist patients, GPS, cardiologists as another
03:03:22.319 tool for people to use at home. Now again I need to backtrack.
03:03:28.560 Around 2015 I was attending a neuroysio private gym having been unable to access
03:03:34.319 any NHS neuroysio assistance. At this time I asked a few questions. I
03:03:40.319 have to admit I can't I can't remember the the topic but it resulted in me
03:03:45.840 being interviewed by a senior lecturer from Manchester Metropolitan University asking if I was prepared to chat with
03:03:52.319 final year physio students. I agreed and that led to annual requests that COVID
03:03:57.680 intervened. The students apparently reported these chats being the best informal part of the course.
03:04:04.800 One day around 2017 missed it again.
03:04:11.840 A short notice appeared on the gymn board asking if anyone had an interest
03:04:16.960 in oral hygiene and strokes. Stupid me. Again, ring a telephone
03:04:22.479 number. I rang the telephone number. Some 40 years earlier, I'd been a
03:04:28.000 qualified dental chairside assistant. I was asked to attend a short interview with Prof, then Dr. Craig Smith. I was
03:04:35.520 delighted to be able to to be asked to join the project.
03:04:43.040 Come on. Come on.
03:04:50.880 I was delighted to be asked to join the project into research of ability to access dental care after strokes.
03:04:57.359 At the first meeting, had I been fully mobile, I'd run away. Faced with all
03:05:02.479 these highly qualified academic folk, but they were very friendly and convinced me that with my background
03:05:08.160 would be very helpful. So, I stayed and it proved to be one of the best things to have happened to me since 2009.
03:05:16.560 At last, I was able to give all my available time and energy to fulfilling not only myself but also the stroke
03:05:23.040 survivors community. I'm very pleased to say that the results of the first work were published with me as contributor.
03:05:32.720 The involvement in general took me to the point where I was able to see that I wasn't totally a waste of space and
03:05:38.399 Colin and I will be ever grateful to Craig. Since then, I've been honored to work with honored to work with Craig, who
03:05:45.920 insists he's addressed by his first name rather than Prof.Smith, on a trial, the results of which have also been
03:05:52.160 published, and two further projects to which have been asked to lead both of the different PPI teams.
03:05:59.600 These cover poststroke subjects in hospital stroke units across the whole of the UK and to last for five years.
03:06:07.600 That takes me to 90 and I hope I make it to the end of both of them.
03:06:12.960 In 2023, I was privileged to be asked by Craig to attend forum Nationwide Stroke
03:06:18.800 Association conference in Birmingham and to address the meeting
03:06:24.479 about my involvement in PPI. The AF and BP testing plus the PPI work
03:06:30.560 have consumed me and I've regained some of my previous self-confidence which you lose when you have a stroke.
03:06:37.520 I can no longer do housework, drive, cook, garden,
03:06:42.960 it haven't controlled of mega budgets or the responsibility of ensuring that
03:06:48.720 staff learn and enjoy their jobs. But at least at last, I feel I'm in a very
03:06:54.399 small way contributing to improve lives of some patients and hoping to prevent others from suffering from strokes.
03:07:04.640 Wait about
03:07:10.960 Something I'd like to suggest to all of you, regardless of your status or areas of responsibility, is at the end of the
03:07:18.399 day, patients are usually quite good judges of their own levels of ability
03:07:23.920 and commitment and can often contribute a lot to success or failure.
03:07:29.920 Some of them will hopefully get a boost to their self-esteem if you could consult them in a PPI role. You never
03:07:36.720 know, you might be recognized as a p by a patient as the one person who came to their rescue from life of gloom and doom
03:07:44.800 into something much more positive. Researchers and innovators, please
03:07:50.399 consider using the lived experience of patients right at the beginning of your research. make sure that it's something
03:07:56.479 that a patient can really relate to and the possibility benefit in crewing.
03:08:02.640 I think that's about the lot of my a bridge story version. Is anybody
03:08:08.000 questions or comments? I'm ready to try and answer them. Thank you for all your
03:08:19.040 Wendy. Um, thank you so much for that. Thank you. Um, sorry about messing. We do have time for
03:08:25.600 maybe one or two questions. Anybody's got any questions for Wendy?
03:08:32.399 Just one at the back over over there. Thank you. One as well. Oh, we'll take the one we'll take the
03:08:38.479 one closest to us for now and then we'll go and take the gentleman at the back and then we'll wrap up. Okay. Um, thanks Wendy for the talk. I
03:08:44.880 really found that inspiring. I just a question really about what did what did you find really helped you with your
03:08:51.120 stroke recovery and um Was there any you talked about some research that you took
03:08:57.040 part in, but was there any other research that um
03:09:02.240 like from universities and stuff that really helped you? No, I think it was just Emma when she
03:09:07.920 came out to do the post post um discharge information because
03:09:14.640 every stroke is different. Every person's reaction is totally different. One thing that really bugs me is when
03:09:21.200 TAS are called strokes because we have a couple of friends in our walking group.
03:09:27.200 Uh we're now lunching rather than walking group. Um but there are a couple of people there who've had TAS and they
03:09:34.240 were always saying well I'm recovered. Why aren't you you're not doing any work? Um which is so so frustrating from
03:09:40.479 a true stroke point of view. Um, I've got friends who despite all their
03:09:46.160 efforts haven't been able to recover their speech. I haven't totally recovered mine, but I've got enough to
03:09:52.800 get by on. Um, I think it it's only Thank you very
03:09:58.560 much. Thanks, Helen. Let's just quickly get the mic across the room if we can.
03:10:07.279 Helen's a gentleman just all the way over there. Can I just add in meantime that um we've
03:10:14.240 been doing quite a lot of work with mosques and the populations are so so
03:10:19.439 grateful for anything we do. Um I don't think anybody leaves us without saying thank you for coming. Thank you for
03:10:25.760 working for us. Um, and one of the very best results or the best um, not
03:10:32.399 results, the best tests I ever did was when we were doing a um, a a session at
03:10:39.680 a mosque where there was a um, a foodie thing going on in the community
03:10:45.200 hall and two young young gentlemen, probably
03:10:50.319 early 20s, having had their food, came to have a look at us, came in. We I took
03:10:56.720 one, Debbie took the other one. Um Debbie's was okay, but mine came up with
03:11:02.479 the cardia as possible AF. So I just said to gentlemen, I'll just write you a
03:11:08.240 letter. You can take it home to your doctor. H no doctor. Sorry, no doctor. I didn't
03:11:16.479 quite get the message, but he really didn't have a doctor. By that time, Debbie had finished her chap. So I said
03:11:24.160 to Debbie, "What do we do now?" And she went outside, found a local lady who
03:11:29.760 said, "I'll sort it." She contacted Dr. GP, took the chap along, and got him an
03:11:36.000 appointment that afternoon. We've no idea what happened to him, but it was, you know, very well worth done.
03:11:43.439 Thank you, Wendy. Final question.
03:11:48.800 Um Um Yeah, fantastic. Um I think for me it's very inspirational to hear your story and I feel like we can connect
03:11:55.760 after this um uh conference today and so you can appear on the podcast which I host which is called everyday people
03:12:01.680 talking health all the way in Manchester but we'll find a way of using uh technology of connecting. Um, I say it's
03:12:08.479 very commendable to you because I live with a health condition myself known as ME/CFS and I've come all the way from
03:12:14.720 from Manchester to kind of experience what healthcare and the sector is doing in terms of innovation and how we can
03:12:21.359 champion uh patients voices because at the end of the day people like yourself are great ambassadors into what
03:12:28.240 solutions we can come up with and help future engagement with communities. So
03:12:33.600 well done. Thank you for the comments. And I think Wendy,
03:12:40.080 I'll be around over lunchtime if anyone's come and try it. I only need two fingers. No jackets off.
03:12:48.160 Excellent. You'll have a cue. Um Wendy, thank you very much. Can we just thank Wendy again?
03:12:57.040 Okay, Wendy, you stay here. I'm just going to um announce our lunchtime slot and then and then we'll we'll leave the
03:13:02.319 stage. Um, okay. So, thank you everyone for well for the morning session. Thank you for your questions and your energy
03:13:08.240 and your activity. I hope you've had value from it. Just to say the afternoon is just as good. We've got an absolute
03:13:14.960 powerhouse um keynote from Tom Reeden. Um I advise you not to miss that. But before then um I'm delighted to announce
03:13:21.520 that it's time for lunch. Now, if you look on your badge, you will see you've got either an orange dot or a blue dot.
03:13:28.479 If you've got an orange dot and you're hungry, great. If you've got a blue dot
03:13:34.479 and you're hungry, I've got some news. Um, basically, we're going to split the
03:13:40.720 lunch into two sessions and we have got and while half of you are having lunch,
03:13:45.840 we have an absolutely stellar event happening upstairs on the second floor
03:13:52.160 of the Tweed Suite. It's women's health. I won't read the full cast list. You've all got the agenda, but Professor Dame
03:13:58.479 Leslie Regan is just waiting for you up there. It's going to be unmissable. If you're not hungry at all, feel free to
03:14:04.160 go to the session twice. Um, that session is going to be just half an hour in length. So, blue dots, you don't have
03:14:10.479 too long to wait. But if I could ask you, if you do have a blue dot, please, please, please do go upstairs. Second
03:14:17.359 floor tree suite for Leslie and Co. Um, our very own Louise Robinson will be chairing that session. That's
03:14:23.600 unmissable. If you have an orange dot, head downstairs for lunch. But then at
03:14:28.800 precisely, let's see what time we on. At precisely
03:14:33.920 13:40, could you orange daughters head upstairs
03:14:39.120 for your women's half slot? Everyone got that? Back in here at Harpers, two for Tom.
03:14:44.800 Thank you.
04:38:51.359 Welcome back. I hope you have all had um a lovely lunch. Um we've had a fabulous
04:38:57.118 morning session. So here now begins the afternoon. Uh so I'm Phil Jennings. I'm
04:39:02.719 the chief exec of Health Innovation Northwest Coast and I'm the vice chair
04:39:08.000 of the Health Innovation Network. So if Richard's Batman, you can think of me as Robin if you like. Um I am also hash
04:39:16.561 proud northerner. So I think it it looks like it's necessary to you know relate
04:39:22.080 my northern credentials. So I grew up in Middlesborough. Uh I went to UN yes the
04:39:28.719 footballing heart of the northeast of England. Thankfully thankfully Sir James
04:39:34.000 is gone now but anyhow so yeah I went to uh uni in Newcastle and was a junior
04:39:39.440 doctor there but I've actually spent most of my clinical career practicing as a GP on Murzy side. So I'm really both
04:39:47.680 privileged and passionate to be uh opening this afternoon session because you as a proud northerner it does mean a
04:39:54.400 lot to me. Why? Because well firstly we're a sick old bunch. So you know the
04:40:00.798 north of England we we recently did some work uh modeling the impact of new
04:40:06.480 cholesterol mod medic medication in England and we found that half of the
04:40:11.600 eligible population live in the north of England covered by one of the health innovation networks that's hosting this
04:40:18.718 event. So half of all of those people are here in the north of England. And the other reason that I'm really
04:40:24.240 passionate about it is because I firmly believe that the north of England is the best place to be doing research and
04:40:31.440 innovation. Whether that's our fabulous clinical institutions, our world leading
04:40:37.840 universities, our manufacturing base, or maybe most importantly, our advanced data
04:40:45.520 infrastructure, arguably the best anywhere in the UK, if not the world. So
04:40:51.200 it's really important that we kind of stand up and punch our weight as North
04:40:56.400 England and you know very very glad to be here today. I think before we um start with the
04:41:03.360 session I thought I'd just offer you three brief reflections from this morning. Um so the first one's about
04:41:10.638 growth. So if you're someone like me and you went to medical school in the 1990s,
04:41:16.480 we didn't talk an awful lot about population health and we didn't talk a lot about the impact that health systems
04:41:24.638 have on the overall health of our population. So far fairly marginal 25
04:41:30.718 30% and obviously now we've come to recognize that those wider determinants
04:41:36.480 are much much more important. It's really important that we embrace
04:41:41.840 that through our kind of research and innovation efforts. So, not just by
04:41:47.840 keeping our own workforce healthy. So, the NHS, universities, local
04:41:54.240 authorities, we're all anchor institutions, we employ huge numbers of people. So, we need to keep our own
04:42:00.560 workforce healthy. But I think more importantly recognizing the contribution that health or rather ill health has on
04:42:08.638 the impact to productivity and our economic prosperity both regionally and
04:42:14.560 and as a nation. So some of the work that Richard mentioned earlier this this morning that we have recently published
04:42:21.920 with Frontier Economics showed that nearly 10% of our GDP can be attributed
04:42:28.958 or 10% negative impact on our GDP down to people who are either too ill to work
04:42:35.600 or they're off work because of their health or they're just not working as productively because of our health. So
04:42:42.080 clearly if we want to grow the economy we can't do that with a sick population.
04:42:47.280 So what we do here to bring prosperity and economic growth to our regions is
04:42:52.560 one of the most important health determin determinants and one of the most impactful actions that we can take.
04:43:00.160 The second thing I think that came out really strongly today uh was about partnership. So, I think there's a a
04:43:06.080 clear message that it's time for the NHS to have a grown-up conversation about
04:43:11.280 industry partnerships. And I think there's a sweet spot where
04:43:17.680 we can work together and through a mature relationship, we can enter partnerships that are good for patients,
04:43:24.718 they're good for the NHS, and they're good for industry as well. and we really need to get over some of these kind of
04:43:32.718 entrenched barriers to working with industry. I think if we're going to move forward in the future, I'd also say to
04:43:39.360 you, think more broadly than just medtech and pharma. So clearly they're hugely important partners, but we do a
04:43:46.480 lot more here in the north of England. We make stuff, okay? We build airplanes and cars and nuclear submarines. We've
04:43:54.000 got nuclear reprocessing facilities. Why is that important? Well, as we move care
04:43:59.920 from hospitals into the community, things like remote sensors, robotics,
04:44:06.560 autonomous systems suddenly become much much more important. So, in fact, there's a big industrial base here with
04:44:14.000 only a small push can become very very relevant to health and our future health.
04:44:20.080 And then finally, the last point is that of adoption. So I was really pleased to
04:44:25.120 hear Sir James say that every problem in the NHS has already been solved somewhere else which is quite heartening
04:44:31.840 I think to hear but that would be our view as well I think as health innovation networks. So we would say to
04:44:37.920 you that the problem is not a lack of technology. The problem is a lack of a
04:44:43.280 systemized process to identify patients who might benefit to trial that
04:44:49.840 technology in real world settings to measure its impacts and outcomes and then to scale that for the rest of the
04:44:57.440 country. And that's really hard. Okay, the adoption part is the most difficult thing that we do. And we'd always say to
04:45:04.798 you that it's usually not the product that's the problem, it's the pathway. So, you know, pathway eats product for
04:45:11.520 breakfast. Um, and if we can't get the clinical pathway sorted out, then often that technology fails. And that's
04:45:18.798 regardless of whether it's got financial backing or clinical evidence. It's it's not as simple as we just need to find
04:45:25.840 money and evidence. It's it's much more complicated than that. And we need to recognize that moving forward. So as we
04:45:32.000 do bring innovation into the NHS, we need to take our colleagues, our
04:45:37.280 workforce along with us, build capacity and capability in our teams and and
04:45:43.360 really foster an innovation ready culture in all of our in all of our systems.
04:45:50.080 So um I'll finish there. Um I think there has never been a better time to be
04:45:56.638 working in innovation than currently we have. You've heard from multiple
04:46:02.240 speakers today. There's a there's a need for innovation. We're backed by policy. It's great to
04:46:09.360 see innovation featuring so prominently in the 10-year plan and the life sector
04:46:15.360 sciences plan and and myself and my colleagues from the other health innovation networks are ready to really
04:46:22.480 scale up our efforts and play an important role in how we help to transform the NHS for the future. So,
04:46:30.080 thank you for that. And what we'll do is we will move on to um the main session.
04:46:36.560 So, as Richard said, if you thought this morning was good, it's only going to get better. Um we've got a stellar cast. Um
04:46:43.760 it's a massive privilege uh to welcome someone who is no stranger uh to this
04:46:49.520 city. So, uh, it's my privilege to introduce and welcome Tom Reedan to the
04:46:55.200 stage, the second permanent secretary at the Department of Health. Tom, over to you.
04:47:04.958 Thanks, Phil. Um, this is different for those of us who don't have good posture as well. I'll be uh swinging around. So,
04:47:11.120 it'll make my my mom telling me get your shoulders back. Um, I um I'm going to
04:47:16.320 spend a little bit of time talking about the 10-year plan and reading from my
04:47:21.440 briefing. Um, and then I'm going to go a bit more me. Um, so you'll probably
04:47:26.638 enjoy the second bit more than the first. Um, and then leave plenty of time for questions. So, um, I'm new to the
04:47:34.560 I'm not an NHS lifer um, and I'm not a Department of Health and Social Care
04:47:40.080 lifer. And that is um a big that's that's it means that you're a sort of
04:47:46.160 slightly different creature when you come into this amazing world of the NHS and health and social care. And I was
04:47:53.680 brought in to try and I think bring that the end of the telescope that is about citizens and um system leadership about
04:48:01.840 working together and getting things to work when they're on the ground in places um rather than the expertise
04:48:10.638 around particular policies that we have lots of people working on. It's been a
04:48:16.160 fantastic privilege to work with Richard and um others in the Yorkshire um and
04:48:21.760 Humber Innovation Network. Um we've done some fantastic stuff over the years.
04:48:27.280 This city is such a an amazing um place for health and social care going right
04:48:33.760 back to Thakray. Um, and fast forward into the to the assets we have, whether
04:48:39.280 that's in the hospital trust and the the other community and mental health trusts in the city, the um the the really a a
04:48:47.840 council that's really committed to collaboration and health and well-being and sees that one of the best ways to
04:48:53.520 help people come out of poverty is to give them the the most healthy lifestyle. um and a fantastic private
04:49:00.000 sector with um you know EMIS, TPP um you
04:49:05.120 know fantastic manufacturing companies that have come out of this part of the world because you had this cluster of
04:49:10.160 brilliant clinicians who who wanted to do things differently. um Baroness Judith Blake who's the uh who's now a
04:49:17.120 minister in the Lords who was leader of the council when I was chief exec her dad um was one of the people who
04:49:23.840 pioneered kidney dialysis out of Leeds so there's like this heritage to the city which is amazing and then the
04:49:29.760 universities of course which are a brilliant um place for innovation to
04:49:35.840 happen and if you can get those different parts working together um then the sky's is the limit really the famous
04:49:42.480 triple helix um approach. We tried to do that in Leeds. I think we've made a lot of success um and it's been done more
04:49:49.200 generally in Yorkshire. That wasn't in my briefing. So, I better get back to my briefing. Five big bets on innovation in
04:49:56.560 the um in the 10ear health plan. Data to deliver impact. Um you know, this is our
04:50:03.040 chance. We we have such a comparative advantage if we get this right and we do it in a way that patients and citizens
04:50:08.560 have confidence in in terms of the use of anonymized um and scaled data in a
04:50:14.400 single data set. That's probably one of the best reflections of the diversity of the world at the moment in terms of the
04:50:21.680 the fantastic diversity of our population. So real opportunities there.
04:50:26.718 AI to drive patient power and productivity. Um the famous doctor in your pocket as Wes would call it. um
04:50:33.280 genomics and predictive analysis for preemptive personalized care starting at birth. Um really really interesting
04:50:40.560 debates that we had about that during the production of the 10-year plan. I was one of those people who who was
04:50:45.600 saying do you think people really want to know um about everything from that age and there's a really interesting set
04:50:51.360 of moral questions about this but I think in terms of particularly um particular specialist um interventions
04:50:58.638 that can happen for rare diseases for example it must be the right way to move forward wearables to make care real time
04:51:05.680 and then robotics to support precision then some great exciting initiatives for
04:51:11.040 the future around global institutes regional health innovation zones um the research environment and innovative
04:51:17.120 medicines um and um and also quite thoughtful stuff around regulators that
04:51:23.360 maybe some people missed where we've realized that MH and NICE you know
04:51:29.120 getting aligned getting the processes ready for the digital age which which
04:51:34.240 they're not quite there yet I think in this space um is something that we're really really keen to do as well and we
04:51:40.080 know how that drives um you know the ability of people to adopt and scale
04:51:45.840 really really significantly. Um and the move to a single national formulary for
04:51:50.878 medicines which I I didn't know what the word formulary meant before I did this job. Um again is one of those things
04:51:57.360 that sounds quite technical but I'm I'm well infor I'm you know been argued to
04:52:02.560 me very strongly this is really really important. We're doing lots. So, I'm going to I'm going to do this the the
04:52:08.798 second part of what I'm going to talk about actually based on Phil's three um areas that he mentioned because in terms
04:52:15.680 of productivity and the UK, you know, this is what we've got to do is turn I
04:52:21.920 mean I I've been on the receiving end of the NHS taking a larger and larger share
04:52:27.600 of public spending because I've managed leads council through 14 years of
04:52:33.200 various elements of austerity. Um and you know there's a we we've got to stop
04:52:40.160 that incessant you know eating up of the proportion of the cake. Um there's that
04:52:46.638 productivity issue. The only way you're going to do that is to get the NHS up and out and to work in partnership to
04:52:53.840 work in systems to get um things to actually happen. And I think one of the
04:52:59.280 things that we felt through the production of the 10-year plan and we had lots of debates, I was often in the
04:53:06.560 room with um Wes called it the Milbourne rear anxis because Alan Milbour is a you
04:53:12.160 know you'll know you know an amazing talented um ex secretary of state really
04:53:17.360 wise experienced voice very much from the um you know the the best you know
04:53:24.480 the greatest hits is coming out at the moment you know the the league tables you know, the the performance and
04:53:30.320 oversight, the singularity of being really clear about what you want from
04:53:35.440 people in terms of electives and GP access and UEC performance, the money,
04:53:41.040 you know, that's really really important. And I ended up I was usually the one saying that's fine, but it's not
04:53:48.000 2001. Um, we've had austerity, we've had COVID, we've had Brexit, we've had all
04:53:53.680 these changes. You know, it's a different world. It's a It's a more complex world. Now, how do we help make
04:54:00.080 systems be able to do those things without it feeling like you're just
04:54:05.520 going through a stove pipe down from the center and people are having to operate in in splendid isolation to achieve
04:54:12.320 them? Because if you look behind all those um targets, then the key to them
04:54:17.840 is not the NHS and the bigger cube trust operating on its own. Of course, some of it is, and it's got to be really, really
04:54:25.040 good at that, but a lot of it is how in productivity terms, we connect with
04:54:30.080 people much better. We have human- centered approaches to public services. We think about that in terms of where
04:54:36.160 people live and where they work. the idea of neighborhood health where we can
04:54:41.920 shift health almost back to where it started in terms of how we can um you
04:54:48.160 know just just get that community-based approach to how people are living their
04:54:53.440 lives and give them more agency in terms of their own health as well. Um and then
04:54:59.280 um and then obviously um the need for um partnership in making that happen. So,
04:55:05.600 moving on to Phil's second point, I I um I'll just run through a few things that
04:55:10.878 we we we're doing at the moment. Um going back to my my briefing, we we're
04:55:16.240 really trying hard to build stronger commercial strategic partnerships in the department and in the NHS and there's a
04:55:23.120 there's a group of people who are working really hard to make that happen and it's manifesting itself in different
04:55:29.600 ways at the moment. So the Colgate partnership around toothbrushing
04:55:34.718 um Colgate Palm Olive partnership around supervised toothbrushing you know I thought the the reaction to that has
04:55:41.040 been really interesting for me you know I I've you know owned public health in the council for many years I thought it
04:55:47.440 was the best decision of the last 20 years actually to bring that back into um into local government where it where
04:55:54.480 it started almost and um back to be able to influence the wider social
04:55:59.520 determinance of health. Um, but there there would have been a reaction I think
04:56:04.718 10 years ago very different to that toothbrushing partnership because people would have said I mean some people did say this well shouldn't the parents just
04:56:11.600 do it but anyone who works in a school or works in the health system and comes across a lot of young kids at the moment
04:56:19.120 will know that some of the biggest problems come from dental um issues. And
04:56:24.480 so I think having a partnership like that that's going to reach up to 600,000
04:56:29.840 children each year is incredibly powerful. And one of those um lowcost no
04:56:35.920 cost options that I try to um talk to my colleagues in the department and in the NHS about instead of this feeling that I
04:56:44.240 think everybody's been a bit hardwired into, which is if it's new, we need more money. We've got to layer it on top of
04:56:50.958 what we do already rather than what a lot of other sectors have had to do much more over the years, which is there's a
04:56:58.400 new issue. How are we going to rep prioritize? What are we going to stop doing or do a bit less of? How can it
04:57:03.600 link to something else? As a critical friend, the NHS has not been good at that. And that's what we've
04:57:10.400 got to get better at. Um there's some really interesting stuff coming out out around intellectual property guidelines
04:57:17.280 for those of you who are interested in that side of the house and that hasn't been reviewed for about 15 years or more
04:57:24.878 and that is going to be really important I think in again trying to make it easier and clearer for organizations who
04:57:32.080 are providing and commissioning services to manage IP strategically and making
04:57:37.840 sure innovations benefit the NHS and the public by securing what are valuable assets rather than just letting them
04:57:44.718 shoot out into the um into the private sector without any attachment back to
04:57:49.840 where they started. Um and so look out for that and I think health innovation networks are going to be involved in the
04:57:56.160 the regional launch of all of that. So that's one to look out for. And the health data research service really
04:58:02.320 really fascinating. I think what an opportunity that is. But what what high stakes there are in that. As we know in
04:58:09.760 the past we've misstepped. If you go wrong with the public on this, it's there's sort of you set back by a
04:58:17.280 decade. So we've been really really careful in thinking that through and
04:58:22.480 trying to get to a position where it's a really um safe and trusted um way of
04:58:30.240 working but also one in which researchers and you know partnership can
04:58:35.280 plug and play into is going to be really really important. Um and um and then
04:58:41.040 other other things that will come as well. I just wanted to finish by talking about I I adoption. I would also um I
04:58:49.200 mean you've heard from Jim earlier and I can't you know I I won't sort of repeat what what Jim said because he's the
04:58:55.840 expert on all of that and he I think the great thing about having someone like Jim at the top table is that he's he's
04:59:02.718 very pragmatic. He's very experienced in what does and doesn't work and he's
04:59:08.798 somebody who really wants to change the system. Um, and so yeah, I I won't I
04:59:14.000 won't add to that, but I just wanted to maybe finish before opening up for questions by talking about, you know,
04:59:19.840 that that triple helix, that industrial partnership. So, I was I was the one who wrote the first check for public money
04:59:26.080 for the um for the advanced manufacturing park in Sheffield. And for those of you who don't know, that was an
04:59:32.400 original partnership between Boeing and the academics in Sheffield University who were experts in metal cutting. um
04:59:40.000 and they were trying to look at how they could utilize that for future composites
04:59:45.600 and um different developments of um of of the aerospace industry and it it was
04:59:51.760 a massive leap of faith. Um I don't think it would have happened today actually. Um and it was one of those
04:59:58.638 where if it had gone wrong I' you probably wouldn't see me here. I'd be on the, you know, in the uh I've been in
05:00:05.360 Wikipedia somewhere as the person who signed away 10 wasted 10 million pounds,
05:00:10.560 but it's had more visits than um I think any installation that I know of.
05:00:15.920 McLaren, Boeing, Rolls-Royce, you know, it's such a fantastic example of how to
05:00:21.200 get it right in terms of that partnership space. And for me that is all about finding um a bit of the ven
05:00:28.400 diagram where commercially you've got to find something that works for the
05:00:33.680 private sector. You can't expect the private sector to just subsidize and you
05:00:40.080 know do everything on the terms of of of central government or the NHS all the
05:00:45.520 time. You've got to utilize the great flare and focus and um and and agility
05:00:52.798 that the private sector's got. Then you've got to bring in the clinical um
05:00:57.920 in our terms the clinical specialist expertise of the NHS and that amazing um
05:01:04.560 you know amazing bit of uh you know uh expertise experience that that the and
05:01:12.240 and actually the NHS brand in global terms for any business is like gold dust
05:01:18.160 really and we don't make enough of that. So, so being part of a a really gold standard partnership makes huge sense
05:01:25.680 for the private sector and and they should put something back because of that. But then crucially, these things
05:01:32.400 happen in places and I was talking to colleagues from Greater Manchester earlier. Um, you know, there are some
05:01:38.240 fantastic things going on around the country and including, you know, not just in Leeds. I'm able to say that in
05:01:44.718 my new job. Um, it was obviously always in leads in my old job. Um but I um I I
05:01:51.200 think that is where the real opportunity is because if you can do that in a way that taps into the asset base that's
05:01:58.958 different in each place um then you know that is powerful and you also get the
05:02:05.680 mayors behind it. You get that ability to s for people to see back to Phil's
05:02:10.878 point about productivity that people are going to get jobs from this. You know they're going to get better health care.
05:02:16.000 They're going to live longer. Um those things are so so important and um yeah
05:02:22.480 I'll I'll finish just by saying um I think Leslie was here earlier on the
05:02:27.600 women's health agenda and I I've seen you know I've I've learned so much in the last year and some of the issues
05:02:34.480 we've got to get right on the women's health agenda are massive and Leslie put it really well in her report um about
05:02:41.680 things like the gynecology waiting list if you look at the number of people who are on that who don't actually need um
05:02:47.840 secondary elective um surgery but are you know are having to wait and hold
05:02:54.958 their lives up because of that. Surely there's better ways of us dealing with issues like that. And then I I was just
05:03:00.638 reading the um some work that's been done on men's health in the in before I came here and 61.5 is the average age of
05:03:10.000 um the for men of healthy working life healthy healthy life you know when when
05:03:16.160 they're living their healthy healthy life bit of their life. Um you know what
05:03:22.240 a waste that is for people and what a what a strain that's putting on the system. So yeah, we've got to make this
05:03:29.760 about people and places and definitely about the people who need our help the most as well, the most um the poorest.
05:03:36.798 Um we've got to help them improve their health the fastest. So I'll finish there and hopefully I've left a little bit of
05:03:43.600 time for questions. Bill, thanks Tom. That was brilliant.
05:03:52.000 So uh we've got roving mics uh just like this morning. So, I think I've got a lady here on my left who'd like to ask
05:03:57.920 the first question. If you can just tell us who you are and where you're from.
05:04:03.280 Yeah. Hi, my name is Maya and I work for Tev UK. Um, my question and and some
05:04:09.680 really great points in that presentation, Tom. Great to hear. uh in terms of adoption, I I agree completely
05:04:16.718 with everything that you said, but how do you at the department ensure that you're staying close to all parts of the
05:04:23.440 system, including the life sciences when you're thinking about policies and moving through with them to ensure that
05:04:31.200 you you understand our world so that there aren't any unintended consequences. I mean I' I've had
05:04:37.280 examples where I've spoken to colleagues for example from NICE through our trade body and some of the assumptions made I
05:04:43.520 don't think are necessarily always checked with the sector and you you know you go ahead and you think you're doing
05:04:49.600 the best thing for all parties involved but how do you actually make sure that that you are listening to the people on
05:04:54.958 the ground who are then having to be part of that adoption.
05:05:00.400 Thank you. Yeah, I I um I absolutely see what you're you're saying. I mean, I've I've
05:05:07.040 so I've worked with the private sector for like 25 years now. I used to be six foot 10 and full head of hair and um I
05:05:14.638 uh I I I love working with the private sector because, as I say, they they bring such a a focus and a drive to to
05:05:22.560 things, but actually they it's great working with the public. It can be great working with the public sector as well
05:05:28.400 if you get it right because the public sector brings a a mandate in terms of
05:05:34.160 democracy and in terms of the ability to get other bits of the system working in
05:05:39.760 the same direction. I think we're we're quite a way off that at the moment in terms of that partnership. It feels like
05:05:45.680 we're a bit stuck. I won't mention the dreaded um acronym um with that begins
05:05:51.520 with V um that some of you will be aware of. But having talked to some CEOs in the in the um life sciences sector, I I
05:06:00.480 really have a desire I've been trying to talk to the department um officials and ministers about this. I've talked to Wes
05:06:06.718 about it about how we can I I think it part you know part of our relationship
05:06:12.560 will always be slightly transactional because it has to be because of it it's about public money it's about
05:06:18.400 transparency it's about contractual issues but there's a big part of it that that needs to be strategic as well and I
05:06:25.200 think the space that you're talking about is where we can get better at having that two-way flow of um of
05:06:32.000 expertise and and information because I I think one of the things the civil service does is move moves people around
05:06:40.240 and so you you lose that institutional memory quite quickly. Um there's also I
05:06:45.280 think more we could do to um improve the commercial expertise that exists within
05:06:51.920 Whiteall and that is changing actually at the moment and that is the the the work that I talked about is is led by
05:06:59.440 some people who've had great careers in the private sector who are now in the system and usually come to me
05:07:07.120 ringing their hands about the bureaucracy. Um, so you've got good advocates within the system now, but
05:07:13.360 yeah, I think we've got to get better at what you what you've just articulated and yeah, I'm I'm sure there are ways
05:07:18.798 that we can. Okay, I don't want to lose this opportunity to have Tom. We've got time for maybe one more question.
05:07:26.958 Okay, gentlemen over there. Hi, Andy Beden from the Global Health Connector. I'm interested to understand
05:07:32.798 how you how we can raise our eyes outside of the UK and think about how do
05:07:37.840 other people do this, you know, whether it's in Europe or Africa or in the US,
05:07:43.360 how are they doing this issue about public private partnerships and what are we doing to sort of try and learn more
05:07:49.360 about them? Yeah. Yeah. So I I went on a um this was before I was in Whiteall actually, but I
05:07:55.920 uh participated in a program with MIT um in Boston and uh Boston,
05:08:02.638 Massachusetts, not Lincolnshire. And um with no disrespect to anyone from Boston, Lincolnshire the um and we we we
05:08:10.560 it was a regional cities innovation program basically. So we we we spent two
05:08:16.320 years um working with Sydney, Oslo, Mterrey, um
05:08:23.120 Kentucky on basically how to make your your economy more innovative. And we we
05:08:30.560 majored on health when we were there and it was fascinating in terms of the
05:08:35.760 differences. I think the SC I think Scandinavia is where I would say we can learn most. I think there's um there's
05:08:43.040 lots that um you know the Danish system is doing for example which I think is making a real difference. Um but you
05:08:51.280 know the um we it's something that I think we've got to utilize the universities for as well
05:08:59.680 because often the universities have those global links already and I think it's one of my great regrets that we
05:09:06.480 haven't come out of Brexit thinking realizing that the wind our one of our big windows to the world is universities
05:09:13.600 and and so building the partnerships that we've got around them and linking up to the knowledge and expert expertise
05:09:20.000 they've got I think is is really important and um you know the private sector as well the big companies operate
05:09:26.878 globally and they have that knowledge and expertise um so yeah I think some of
05:09:32.718 it is in our own country I do think the advance advanced manufacturing park I think some of the things that we do in
05:09:39.280 um you know in in health innovation are absolutely will stack up in terms of what's happening around the world but I
05:09:45.920 think we can get better um the states are much better finance. They're much better at not relying on
05:09:53.200 the bank of Mum and dad for entrepreneurship. Um, and I think that's where we suffer a lot. We don't think
05:09:59.680 about our finance system in in as the fourth bit of the helix, which is what
05:10:05.600 we learned on the MIT work. Um, so yeah, they're they're the ones I would say.
05:10:11.280 Okay. Well, look, we could talk all afternoon, but I will have to draw that to a close. Tom, thank you for those
05:10:17.120 insights and giving you time this afternoon. And folks, can we just show uh Tom our appreciation?
05:10:27.680 Okay, so I'm now going to introduce our next panel chair. Now, I've done this
05:10:32.958 before and this person will try and tell you he is a humble plumber from Essics.
05:10:38.718 Don't believe a word of it. Okay. So our next chair has been a massive advocate
05:10:44.958 for innovation uh for innovation organizations like ours in health innovation network and
05:10:51.920 most importantly for innovators themselves in the NHS in all kinds of guises through the clinical entrepreneur
05:10:59.520 program. So it's an absolute privilege to welcome yet again supporting us
05:11:04.560 professor Tony Young. [Applause]
05:11:13.920 Thank you very much. Um,
05:11:24.010 [Laughter] I'm not going to rise to that. Richard, I was a young man when I first met
05:11:30.878 Richard and so was Richard. It was 13 14 years ago I think when you were in the
05:11:37.440 2010 was it 15 years ago. He looked very No, you look the same actually. Not far.
05:11:42.798 I had short hair then. I had short hair then. Right. Hello. So I am Tony Young.
05:11:48.638 And I am a consultant urological surgeon in Mid and South Essics. And I was trying to think um after Phil gave his
05:11:55.600 great um introduction to his northern roots, how you would welcome an Essex boy. Um although I' on my grandparents
05:12:05.040 side they're all from Newcastle and Math and Dennington so I think I can claim
05:12:10.080 that but I was thinking about um a great innov how could what would we have
05:12:15.440 between Essex and the North in innovation and of course the greatest
05:12:20.798 symbol of innovation um in the world is the light bulb. It's
05:12:26.718 the one that's international and of course that was invented in the north of England as you will all know. You know
05:12:32.320 that don't you know this? Um but the story is and Essex has a great medical
05:12:39.200 history as well. I should say you didn't I bet you didn't know that. Um in in um
05:12:44.958 with the light bulb with Joseph Swan and it's a story and we heard there was a question up here about industry and
05:12:50.240 working together. So, Joseph Swan invented the light bulb, but everyone on the planet outside of the north of
05:12:56.638 England thinks it was Thomas Edison, the American. And Joseph Swan took him to court in
05:13:02.638 London um over his patent and he won.
05:13:07.760 He then went to New York and took Edison to court on the basis of his patent and
05:13:14.000 Edison bought the Swan Company. Doesn't that happen again and again and
05:13:20.878 again? And we were hearing from um our chief executive this morning and we've
05:13:26.080 just heard from our second permanent secretary. We need to keep it here. We need to grow it here. We need to get the benefits here. And maybe we're going to
05:13:32.400 hear a little bit about homegrown innovation on this panel. Does anyone know who the greatest medical innovator
05:13:38.958 from Essex or historical one was? Joseph Listister. Did you know Joseph
05:13:46.000 Listister was an Essex boy? You see? So there we are. So anyway, so right um I
05:13:52.798 get I have one of the greatest jobs I think in in the National Health Service because I get to see all the latest
05:13:58.000 greatest things and there are some it's I know we've heard from Jim and we've
05:14:04.400 heard from Tom and Richard and and we know I know it's difficult. I understand
05:14:09.840 it. I am married to a GP. Every night pillow talk is about the problems of
05:14:15.040 primary care. I get it. Gosh. Um yeah,
05:14:20.080 there's GPS in the audience going on. We talk about the same thing. Um
05:14:26.000 but actually it's a really really exciting time. Um and I don't know if you've seen what's coming down the line,
05:14:32.878 particularly with quantum, but it's getting really exciting. We're starting
05:14:38.400 to understand where consciousness comes from. um you know quantum biology and other
05:14:45.520 things and we are second in the world only just behind the Americans on what we are investing in quantum and doing
05:14:52.480 we've got lots of that research based in the north as well so it's just and that do you know that would unlock that
05:14:58.160 science fiction stuff that's going to unlock it it's so I'm so glad I was alive now I thought I'd missed it all
05:15:04.240 when X-waves were invented or discovered before I was born and antibiotics and other things but no now so it's so you
05:15:11.520 are going to see some really exciting things. Okay, we're going to show you but but they're practical. They're
05:15:17.040 things that are making a difference across the north of England right now.
05:15:22.160 But what we're going to do first of all is we're going to have a panel and I've
05:15:27.680 ask my panelists to come up and join us now and take a seat up here. Um, and um,
05:15:36.878 we've got a couple of questions we're going to put to them because it sounds great, doesn't it? And we hear all about
05:15:44.160 how wonderful innovation is. Oh, if only the NHS took it up. If only you stopped triing it and you adopted it across the
05:15:50.480 whole and and we hear all those things and these are three people that come
05:15:56.080 from different parts of the system and supported in different ways. So one of
05:16:02.480 the things I do in my background I I took the step into industry as a junior doctor and started I've started four
05:16:08.480 companies raised five million exited them all nearly lost my house on on one of my startups so I had invested so much
05:16:15.360 in it and then when I came to NHS England as the national clinical director for innovation 12 years ago now
05:16:23.040 um I got the opportunity to start the clinical entrepreneur program and we were here and I'd caught Tom just as he
05:16:29.440 was going out I need to brief him I'm not I'm sure he knows quite how good our some of our innovation programs are.
05:16:35.280 He's new in post. So, um we need to make sure he knows all about them. It's the
05:16:40.958 world now the world's leading entrepreneurial startup program in healthcare and life sciences. It's been
05:16:48.560 entering into 10 years. You're going to hear from one or two of them a bit later. Um what have we done? It's a
05:16:54.798 workforce development program supporting the National Health Service. In our first 10 years, we founded just under
05:17:00.560 600 life science companies. Between them, they've benefited over 200 million
05:17:06.000 patients and professionals that we can count. And we've now raised over 1.5 billion pounds of funding mostly from
05:17:12.560 American venture capital actually to drive those forward. But then the other joy I had at NHS England is I was around
05:17:19.120 at the time when we founded our national innovation accelerator. You'll hear about that. And I was involved in the
05:17:24.480 innovation health and wealth report which set up the forerunner to the hins or the rebrand the hins are the new
05:17:31.200 brand name for the academic health science networks. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask so that's me and
05:17:37.920 who I am. I'm going to ask each of our panel just to introduce themselves because they each bring a very different
05:17:43.280 experience. I've got a couple of questions I'm going to ask them around things and then I'm hopefully we're
05:17:49.200 going to have a little bit of time for one or two questions from you. But then what I want you to do is we've got four
05:17:56.480 innovative companies here who are all deployed across the north that we've been supporting either through the
05:18:02.958 entrepreneur program or through our national innovation accelerator. All of them have been supported through our
05:18:08.080 health innovation networks in one way or another, particularly in the north, that they're going to come and give
05:18:13.280 four-minute pitches and then we're going to grill them a little bit and ask them what's good, what's not and go like
05:18:19.200 that. Okay. And you're welcome to contribute to that as well. So Jack, why don't you start? Great. Um, thanks everyone. I'm Jack
05:18:26.080 Porter. I'm the co-irector of the NHS or National Innovation Accelerator. Um um
05:18:32.160 I've been in life sciences since I was 18 where I got my first internship. So I've done uh multiple different roles in
05:18:39.200 farmer diagnostics uh personalized medicine and then some health tech startups as well. Uh all went really
05:18:45.120 well, one went really badly. Um but it was good fun. Uh and I've been running the NIA for the last two years.
05:18:51.280 And Jack, can I just ask you what's the favorite thing you've got in your job that you do at the moment? What was
05:18:57.840 uh I think part of my job is being a therapist for 50 founders and fellows.
05:19:03.440 Um which is very good fun. Um but every day is is different because everyone's got their own challenges.
05:19:09.520 Yeah, it's true, isn't it? It does feel like that trying to get a you wouldn't think and you know there's a difference
05:19:15.200 between the UK and the US. We are very good at testing and triings here. We have some good networks and some good
05:19:21.520 innovation infrastructure. In the US, it's mostly done in the tech companies.
05:19:26.560 I learned the other day, do you know what the most common advert in Silicon Valley is for now in the tech sector?
05:19:34.240 It's something for called FDE. Does anyone know what FTE is? I had
05:19:39.920 never heard of it. It's called a forward deployed engineer.
05:19:45.040 And suddenly the tech companies have discovered instead of sending salespeople out, let's put engineers
05:19:50.400 into the company so they can understand the company's problems and help design that rapidly. And I'm going, oh, health
05:19:57.440 innovation network's national innovation accelerator entrepreneur program. Isn't that our version? But it's 10 to 15
05:20:04.638 years old of forward deployment of engineers supporting our frontline staff to help change the system in what we do.
05:20:11.760 There's not always bigger and better in America. Sorry. Thanks Tony. Hi everybody. I'm Nicola
05:20:17.120 Hutchinson. I'm chief officer of health innovation northeast North Cumbria. I helped to found the what was the
05:20:22.638 academic health science network for the northeast north cumbria back in 2012 and I also act as an adviser to the
05:20:30.000 northeast north cumbry integrated care board with regard to innovation. Brilliant. What in your role as a a hint
05:20:37.760 CEO, what's the what's the favorite bit of your job that you I might ask you the nastiest bit later, but the favorite
05:20:43.760 bit? I think the favorite bit is I'm from Newcastle. I'm gobby. I like to talk. I like to talk and we get to meet lots and
05:20:50.320 lots of different people from across a vibrant ecosystem. I think the best thing is when you can join the dots and
05:20:55.840 you can kind of be the glue with cohesion and you see things come to fruition. So that's probably the best.
05:21:01.920 And we're going to see you have quite a good track record of making innovation happen actually. And we'll see that it'll come up with some of the
05:21:07.120 companies. Yes. Next. All right. Uh my name is Vlad. Vladimir
05:21:12.400 Gubala. I go by Vlad because the name Vladimir certain person didn't make our
05:21:18.240 name very good job. So let's just shorten it. Is that Vlad the Impaler you refer? Well, I'm from Slovakia. So not you know
05:21:24.878 he was in Romania. So I'm East European. Okay. Okay. Uh you know something like that. Um I'm
05:21:30.400 a former academic. I used to uh be a lecturer at the school of pharmacy in an
05:21:35.840 unnamed university. Um so I was always close to healthcare. And in 2019 I
05:21:42.320 co-founded a health tech company called Pokedoc Pocket Doctor point of care
05:21:47.360 doctor. Pokedoc right. Yeah. Easy. So we operate in a space of preventative
05:21:53.120 health care. We effectively revolutionize the way health checks is delivered across the country. And we
05:22:01.040 have a product that you can do a health check uh and a stratified risk of cardiovascular disease in the comfort of
05:22:08.560 your house in the communities in the middle of a field or at football matches, mosques, churches, everywhere.
05:22:16.400 uh and all in 10 minutes results stream directly to your NHS app if you have NHS
05:22:22.480 app link with the GP connect GP records so it's all streamed and all in a
05:22:28.400 digital format way um so I was going to ask you what your
05:22:33.600 favorite thing is about what we do but I want to ask you something different why do you do what you do because if
05:22:39.440 business is about making money you could probably make more money in another sector so why have you left what you
05:22:44.878 were doing to come and on this that's an interesting one I think the answer is actually also relatively
05:22:50.560 simple when I was academic and this is probably one of the things in academia we always in academia always won't say
05:22:58.160 always many of us will look at things and say this is what interests me this is what I want to do and then we come up
05:23:04.878 with some solution of something and then we are frantically trying to try find a
05:23:10.638 problem where the solution can be applied so I at some point I had enough I said this is wrong. I mean we should
05:23:16.878 be really going after the problem first do the you know do the due diligence
05:23:22.480 find out what the user requires and then apply a solution to it. So that's why I
05:23:27.840 switched from a very comfortable I have to say academic life is quite comfortable.
05:23:32.958 It was really comfortable life for me but in in this private sector it's a huge stress but then the reward is and
05:23:40.080 this is my favorite part comes is when you actually see how the technology works in the world. So I don't spend
05:23:46.638 time only in my little lab or in my office. I go out there, I spend time with nurses and doctors and pharmacists
05:23:54.160 and and I see talk to people how they use technology and it's it's super
05:23:59.200 rewarding to to hear that I dream myself about how people should use my
05:24:05.040 technology, what impact it should make. I can I can write thousands of words of how impactful this technology is, but
05:24:12.400 nothing comes to even close when you meet a real person who tells you I gave up smoking because I use your test and
05:24:20.560 it showed me I have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and now I'm slimmer. I run with my grandchildren. I
05:24:28.000 play with them and I have much happier life. That is absolutely invaluable for
05:24:33.040 me. So that's what I enjoy the most. Isn't Isn't that really interesting because I had um a group from the
05:24:39.280 University of Washington came over recently to see me at NHS England and they were looking at our health
05:24:44.798 innovation ecosystem here um in the UK and they just said you know we have
05:24:50.240 nothing like this in America. They said how do you get your workforce involved
05:24:56.000 in innovation? Ours just are burnt out. Go in bill their hours fill in their EPRs and go home. They can't get away
05:25:02.320 quick enough. And all we have are tech companies coming to us with solutions
05:25:07.760 they think work but they don't understand the healthcare. So to hear your passion and your drive and your commitment and I didn't ask you what
05:25:14.240 your favorite thing was going to be because I thought you might say it was going to be the therapy sessions you have with Jack because you're on the
05:25:21.120 national innovation accelerator. We'll do it after we'll we'll we'll come on top. So look
05:25:26.400 um it's difficult. We have heard things are difficult at the moment. But I think
05:25:32.400 everyone in this room is here because you want to make things better. You want to improve patient care. You want to
05:25:38.958 improve patient experience. You want to improve the experience of um the workforce, but actually you want to do
05:25:46.160 that scalably as well. Not just as we heard earlier, didn't we? I can't
05:25:51.680 remember if it was um Jim or Tom um that said it about just one small area where
05:25:57.600 it goes on but the ward next to you or the general practice a few miles down the road. Maybe there's a question that
05:26:02.798 came out earlier that brought that up and it doesn't happen. So we just don't want to make that impact but we want to
05:26:08.798 scale it too and we know it's really hard and you know evolution teaches us.
05:26:14.160 So evolution just runs experiments lots and lots of experiments and then the mutation that work actually is selected
05:26:22.718 and then goes and grows doesn't it so our panel between us you've seen lots of
05:26:28.320 experiments you've done lots of things why I want to ask and I don't have the
05:26:33.440 answers I don't know what the lottery winning numbers are going to be this week I know them from last week not this
05:26:38.560 week um but you can learn from the mistakes of others you can learn from
05:26:44.480 the experience. So are there any insights and it's a safe space and if you don't want anything put on social
05:26:49.920 media just say that's fine. um to say are there any insights you've gained of
05:26:55.600 where you've really seen something work and be taken up and then on the other hand you've seen examples of never do
05:27:03.760 this again never take this approach again it was a disaster and it failed
05:27:09.120 because sometimes sharing those insight and there's no where's the forum for talking about the absolute disasters
05:27:14.638 that happened you know it doesn't happen does it here Jack do you want to start
05:27:20.480 insights you've gained from the NI So um on the NIA we've got 53 fellows right
05:27:26.958 now I think about 100 companies today over the last 10 years um through the program some of them are are now well
05:27:33.200 all the big um names within the health tech space kind of touched the program at some point and I guess if we're
05:27:38.798 talking about insights in terms of what's worked well what hasn't worked well I I'd pull out two words so I think
05:27:44.080 trust is the first one uh which we can expand on and then also a lack of complacency is I think very very
05:27:51.040 important when it comes to actually being an innovator, being a founder itself. Um, I go to a lot of these
05:27:57.120 events and I have conversations every day pretty much with a innovator who's got a a solution which they're saying is
05:28:04.798 not being adopted within the system. And I think there's a big difference between um the NHS doesn't adopt innovation and
05:28:11.360 the NHS doesn't adopt my innovation. Um, which I think is a real distinct difference that we need to really kind
05:28:16.878 of hit home on. Um I think if you go to enough conferences you would think that nothing new has been picked up across
05:28:22.558 the NHS for the last 10 20 years but actually in reality that's not true at all. So NIA fellows at the moment were
05:28:29.520 they're averaging out about 30 deployments a month across the 50 that are currently on the program. So this
05:28:34.798 stuff is definitely happening. Um I think there's a the difficulty is
05:28:41.920 in in any other industry. So before I uh came into the NHS innovation accelerator, I was a commercial lead of
05:28:48.878 one of the the first fellows to go through the program actually. And um we also solved farmer and in pharma there
05:28:57.200 are exactly the same problems that you have scaling within the NHS. Before you get a contract you have to go through a
05:29:02.480 six-month farmer IG process. Um everyone in you know you might sell it to one department in pharma they don't
05:29:08.638 necessarily speak to the next department. Countries don't speak to other countries. exactly the same problems and there isn't actually 15
05:29:14.400 health innovation networks for example helping us to do that I can scale within that industry so I think it's unique
05:29:19.760 within the NHS here um so lack of complacency is is one of the key points and then I think trust is the other
05:29:25.200 element to it as well so um I think all of these everything is scaled based on
05:29:30.400 relationships so it's a relationships game at the end of this and trust is
05:29:36.400 incredibly important to actually getting something to be able to scale across the system and there are programs out there
05:29:42.480 that can help build that trust. Right? So, um NIA um clinical entrepreneurs program, SPRI, the health innovation
05:29:48.958 networks, we all have our own due diligence and assessment processes that are that are tough to get on to, right?
05:29:54.718 It's hard to get onto our program. Um we have 300 applications. We take on about 20 a year. So, having those badges and
05:30:02.320 across the different programs across NHS England and the wider kind of accelerated accessive
05:30:07.840 um is incredibly useful as well. I don't think so. I think that's a great point. And just remind me, is the NIA still
05:30:13.520 open for applications at the moment? It is still open. Good. I thought I'm amazed you missed that. Yeah. Two more weeks. Still open.
05:30:19.760 Have a look, Nichl. Thank you. So, yeah, I guess building on that. So, I've spent the last 20 years of my career working regional innovation
05:30:26.878 in the Northeast and North Cumbria. I know I don't look old enough, but I guess I've during that time we've I've
05:30:32.878 worked on thousands of innovations. And with that we built our innovation pathway which became a regional
05:30:38.400 blueprint. The health innovation network isn't an expert at all in kind of all aspects of that innovation life cycle.
05:30:44.958 But it's going back to the point you were making Jack about working in collaboration with partners who are the experts and working together because we
05:30:51.760 are stronger together and playing to our strengths. And I guess the as part of that as well the other thing we have to
05:30:57.360 consider is about failing fast. you know, we get a lot of or not so much now, but in the early days of the
05:31:02.638 academic health science network, we did get a lot of Mark six generation walking sticks, and I'm I'm not even joking. Um,
05:31:09.600 and and and that, you know, people were spending their life savings on walking sticks and the the NHS already has a
05:31:15.600 very perfect adequate walking stick. So, I think it's working together, but also ensuring that we fail fast and we we we
05:31:22.080 learn from one another. But collaboration and trust I I would agree is absolutely and it's a hard thing to hear failing
05:31:28.718 fast particularly if you're a company and an innovator and you put everything in and you're getting that feedback but
05:31:34.798 I think what you're hearing the honesty and trust and I think honesty then brings trust is and glad you've been on
05:31:43.280 the NIA you've been supported by health innovation networks um uh you will have
05:31:48.798 had some very honest feedback I have no doubt in some of this From your perspective as an innovative company,
05:31:56.240 what are the insights that you've got that would say this has helped us and this hasn't worked. This is what I valued. This has been of no use
05:32:03.520 whatsoever and it may be failing fast in an area and knowing in that part of the country I'm just not going to get this
05:32:09.760 over the line because they've already got something that's not too dissimilar but not quite the same. You know what is
05:32:15.920 it? I mean every company, every health tech company, whatever solution we
05:32:22.798 propose, the one thing we we need, we need to sell it, right? And then to sell it, you need to validate that the
05:32:30.160 solution actually works. We were fortunate, lucky, whatever you call it,
05:32:36.798 we partnered with the right partner at the time and we were partnering actually Nicola knows with H Highen, so northeast
05:32:43.600 North Kumbria. Uh it was part of a pilot project at the time uh when we were
05:32:49.920 deploying 10,000 of our tests to screen just a relatively small cohort of people
05:32:55.200 out of half a million eligible people in the in the Nank region who are due to
05:33:00.798 have health checks and 50% of them never had the health check although they were actually eligible. So we only started
05:33:06.958 with this 10,000 small cohort. Right now we surpassed this number. Obviously we're way beyond that number but this
05:33:14.240 proved to be extremely valuable for us as a company. And there's the
05:33:19.360 partnership and trust and the fact that we whether it was serendipity or whatever I don't know but it we picked
05:33:25.680 the partner we kind of run into each other that there was the trust and the fact that the partner was able to
05:33:31.920 embrace technology because we also obviously in the meantime there's 40ome
05:33:37.120 ICBS across the country not every ICB is that open not every ICB will be
05:33:44.400 welcoming technologies but we were fortunate at the time that it just happened very well with the high
05:33:51.440 and that's just simply how it all started. So we're expanding but in a in a safe space what's been
05:33:58.160 your biggest mistake? Uh mistake was there was I wouldn't say the biggest mistake there were always
05:34:03.680 hiccups and there always are and will be hiccups. One of the hiccup was that at certain stage we considered that we
05:34:10.080 would outsource the production and the manufacturer of our product somewhere
05:34:15.200 else. could guess where I mean there's a one place in the world where they manufacture everything but we very
05:34:22.160 quickly backtracked from that and we now fully manufacture everything inhouse and
05:34:29.520 it was a big learning curve for us lots of time wasted so lots of resources wasted too to realize that actually to
05:34:38.000 have a full control over manufacturing process and the quality of the product yeah
05:34:43.200 we must manufacture here and we actually source almost the entire uh inventory
05:34:50.320 entire stocks of what goes into the product from local sources or from at
05:34:55.920 least European sources. So that's that was a big learning page. It's a great sales pitch to this audience. That's a great sales pitch.
05:35:03.440 Right. I want to I want to move us on. I've got one more um quick question. Is Laminos my colleague from there? There
05:35:09.520 he is over there. Just stand up and wave. There he is. Right. You'll see why he's important in a minute. You might want to go and talk to him in the break
05:35:16.400 over there. So one of the things that I have been trying to do and I have failed
05:35:24.400 as a leader at NHS England for 12 years. I have tried to persuade my chief
05:35:33.760 executives, my other directors, government ministers that now after 23 years, it is time that
05:35:42.558 we as an organization updated our intellectual property policy for the
05:35:47.760 nation. I think 23 years smartphones weren't around. We just about decoded
05:35:52.798 the genome. Um, AI, I'm not sure it existed in that form. Certainly not quantum.
05:35:59.040 Um and last when new government came in and I thought I'm going to have another go and I went to see Baroness Marin and
05:36:07.760 she got on board and now Minister Ahmed our newly appointed minister responsible
05:36:13.600 for innovation um at the department of health um is our backer and supporter and we
05:36:20.638 are anticipating later this month maybe might drift a bit
05:36:26.160 we haven't got an exact date yet but later this of them. For the first time in 23 years, we will publish updated
05:36:32.878 intellectual property guidelines for the NHS, which is I'm so pleased because that will really help innovation across
05:36:40.480 the system and what we're doing. And if you've got any questions you want to ask, Laminos is over there. You can go and see him in the break. That's why
05:36:46.638 he's here. It's from our commercial team at NHS England. We've worked across the Department of Health, the NIHR, with our
05:36:53.360 health innovation networks as well. And we'll come on and talk about that. But what I wanted to ask each of you briefly
05:36:58.958 because in commercial negotiations, you know, we've heard about we want to get economic growth. We want a national
05:37:04.320 growth service, not just a national health service. How do we get companies to manufacture to build their products
05:37:10.958 here to test and trial them here? How do we how do we get that benefit from that um innovation here um in our economy?
05:37:18.400 Have you got any examples either good or bad related to intellectual property
05:37:24.080 that you want to share? And hopefully Laminos is gonna have all your answers about IP in the break. If you haven't
05:37:30.558 heard Laminos, it's over there. He's the one to go and see. All right. Right, Jack. Okay. Um, so I'll start I think with a
05:37:38.320 example of how big the prize can be. Um, so has anyone here heard of Nerve Center
05:37:45.280 software, right? So, so Nerve Center was one of the first companies to go through the NIA in 2015. So they joined us when
05:37:51.360 they were I think eight or nine people um one two years into their journey um
05:37:56.400 and have co-created their product with the NHS. Now I don't believe there is a commercial deal in place with their
05:38:02.558 center but now they are 300 plus people they want more APR contracts than any
05:38:07.920 other provider. So the big US providers in the UK last year and all it's going to take is one international contract
05:38:14.160 for them to be able to pay back all of the support they've had from the system over the last 10 years. So winning just
05:38:20.400 one contract. Um so I think that's like a that's an example of you know if we get it right that's what we can bring
05:38:25.680 back in terms of where it hasn't worked and again we've we've seen examples of this on the program. I would ask
05:38:31.760 everyone to ask themselves the question like would would you rather have 50% of
05:38:37.280 um 50 well actually would you rather have 5% of 10 million or 50% of nothing
05:38:43.920 right which is I think we've seen quite a few examples where in um IP but also
05:38:49.440 within kind of commercial partnerships and joint ventures where um a organization is suffocated by too much
05:38:55.680 control being taken by the NHS partner within this and actually we need to take a bit of a step back from those uh let
05:39:02.480 people get on with what they need to get on with which is running a scaling tech company and be happy with letting them
05:39:08.798 get on with it as well. So your view is very aligned with uh Lord Valance our science minister who shared his um
05:39:16.480 opinion with us on what he thinks he's very much he supported area our advanced research and innovation agency where he
05:39:23.040 really wants to kind of seed the cloud as he puts it you know DARPA seeded the internet didn't they and the American
05:39:29.200 economy has massively scaled but it doesn't own the internet does it so there is that approach of of how do you
05:39:34.878 get that Nicola thank you um yeah so I guess um I really welcome the uh the review of the
05:39:41.360 intellectual property policy. I know you and I have it's like groundhog day, Tony. We've talked about this for about 15 years. Uh intellectual property feels
05:39:48.000 like a masterminded subject for me. I love it. Um so in the northeast and north Cumbria we are a little bit
05:39:53.360 different in terms of the health innovation network because as part of our inception we actually consume the
05:39:58.798 NHS intellectual property hub which is where I came from. So I guess as a health innovation network, we have that
05:40:05.200 holistic approach across all of our um providers, our ICB. We've drafted all of the IP policies which I guess has helped
05:40:12.798 us in terms of what have we done well. We know we know what the what the what the trust is producing. We know how to
05:40:18.400 kind of engage with industry and I guess that then has led to um some of the work
05:40:23.840 and Sam alluded it to this morning around kind of us executing deals with the likes of Boringer. Um so I guess
05:40:29.440 there's more of that to come. I think the guidance we we've worked closely with DHSSE on the guidance. So I think
05:40:35.040 it gives more practical um examples and support for those regions that maybe haven't had the beauty of having an
05:40:41.120 intellectual property of working with them. So I think it really gives you know it gives great guidance and great
05:40:46.638 hope for the future. So uh things that haven't worked so well I guess is when when people don't consider intellectual
05:40:52.638 property being important and it's an afterthought. And then you know we've seen some great examples of fantastic
05:40:57.680 innovation that would really really um change patient lives but unfortunately
05:41:03.680 the intellectual property has been destroyed and it's not being considered from the outset and therefore as a consequence those innovators haven't
05:41:10.160 been able to secure investments um and it's been really really tragic and as a consequence we end up with oneoff
05:41:16.558 prototypes that kind of the press will get a hold of of things like oh the medical physics department in Newcastle
05:41:22.160 knocked it up in the shed. Uh it's not commercially available and it's a it's a result of that that kind of it was an
05:41:27.760 afterthought and unfortunately that really really uh inhibits innovation. So it's you're right it's
05:41:35.280 and I hope when you see them when they come out we've had to take an approach that's flexible to allow the kind of
05:41:42.320 very libertarian view that Jack has kind of taken to going to the other end to
05:41:47.440 saying there's a responsibility on us as a receiver of public money to make sure we're protecting things and supporting
05:41:53.360 them. Vlab, what's your experience of working with the NHS and contract negotiations and IP and and how have you
05:42:01.040 found that working with them? Have you done deals? Have you worked with them? What what's happened? What's your
05:42:06.320 experience? Uh our experience with IP as a company is is I'm a little bit torn always with
05:42:11.840 this IP issue because on the one end I understand the importance of the IP and
05:42:18.958 the the fact that NHS also requires it and whatever. But but at the same time
05:42:24.480 my view the strategic view is that I will only protect intellectual property if I can police it. I you know sometimes
05:42:33.520 again coming from academia we try to protect everything every idea every sneeze that we had in the office we try
05:42:39.600 to put on the paper and and pay £15,000 just just to write it up as a patent application but
05:42:45.440 but the reality is that if I cannot police it I would rather keep it as a knowhow because by by filing a patent
05:42:54.000 application you effectively are putting it in in the public domain all your secrets and everything but if you cannot
05:43:00.240 police did you're just telling people here's a recipe of stuff you can do it anytime you like so it has to be bit of
05:43:06.798 a sensible approach I do like the fact that the the guidelines are being reviewed because it's absolutely due but
05:43:14.000 at the same time there needs to be more sensible approach of what is it that we're trying to protect and some things
05:43:20.080 are more worth to keep as a secret Coca-Cola is a good example isn't it the
05:43:25.440 most successful drink in the world still keeping the recipe secret in the whole in Atlanta Yeah. No. And and I hear lots
05:43:32.160 of companies talk about the importance of that particularly with some AI things which are much more difficult about that knowhow and thing is really important.
05:43:39.200 Now I am running a little behind time. So I'm not going to open up to questions just yet but I would like you three to
05:43:46.240 say and listen to the pitches that are about to come and you can ask a
05:43:52.400 question. It can be don't hold back. If you got something bold you want to say that you don't think it's been answered
05:43:57.920 and if you got something complimentary, you can say that too. First up, we've got four minutes. So, I'm going to time
05:44:03.280 you. I'm going to sit in the front row. I think it's Laura.
05:44:12.480 Four minutes. Laura, I know the clock is ticking. Go fast. You got a mic? I've not got a mic.
05:44:23.440 Thank you. Perfect accessory for my outfit as well. Amazing.
05:44:31.360 Where am I looking? I'm looking here. Perfect. Good afternoon. Let me start by
05:44:36.718 acknowledging the very real challenges that we're facing when it comes to children and young people's mental
05:44:42.480 health. We're all acutely aware of the workforce crisis that we face. rising
05:44:48.080 demand for SEN support, huge demands in emotionally based school avoidance
05:44:53.760 increasing, CAM's referrals at record highs, and long waiting lists stretching beyond what families can tolerate. And
05:45:01.280 at the same time, the 10-year plan is asking us all to work differently and to take on a new approach, shifting to
05:45:08.000 prevention, to community, and to digitally based services. And that's really where we come in. My name is
05:45:14.798 Laura and I'm the founder and CEO of My Healthy Mind. I'm also a trustee at the Mental Health Foundation and a proud NIA
05:45:22.080 fellow and I can confirm also one of Jack's therapy clients.
05:45:27.520 My Happy Mind is a whole school mental health program that teaches every child
05:45:33.040 science-backed habits that support good mental health. Delivered through a digital platform, it's easy to scale,
05:45:40.080 consistent in quality, and fully embedded into the daily life of schools.
05:45:45.520 It's delivered by teachers, enabling a palpable culture shifts in schools.
05:45:52.160 In practice, we enable schools to provide effective early help and preventative services. We changed the
05:45:59.600 reflex in schools from being one of referring children out to supporting
05:46:05.840 children within. We're commissioned in 40 places across
05:46:11.040 the system and impacting a million people now working in over 2,000 schools and we're very proud to be commissioned
05:46:17.600 across Greater Manchester, Cheshure and Muryside, North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. We've shown that we can
05:46:24.240 deliver a 46x ROI in year And these returns aren't just
05:46:30.480 theoretical. They're built from tangible outcomes. Fewer children being referred
05:46:35.760 to CAMS, fewer children being referred to mental health support teams, fewer demands on senkos from within schools,
05:46:43.760 and improved attendance of those children for whom the school system often means they get excluded.
05:46:50.400 In short, we create a system whereby less demand flows into already massively
05:46:56.798 overstretched services within the NHS. We're effectively an educational
05:47:02.000 solution that delivers health care outcomes. We work hand inhand with
05:47:07.120 systems and in some areas we form part of the mental health support team offer enabling them to scale faster, more
05:47:13.200 cheaply and with better impact. We also support the neighborhood approach to
05:47:18.400 mental health where schools don't sit outside of the pathway but sit firmly within it. They become the first line of
05:47:25.200 prevention and early help easing the load on specialist services while ensuring that children get the right
05:47:31.600 support at the right time and in the right place. We all know about the three shifts. I
05:47:38.160 don't need to repeat them today, but my happy mind is an absolute example of how this can work in practice. It's about
05:47:45.360 moving care upstream, delivering care closer to home in schools, and truly focusing on prevention.
05:47:52.480 So, when you think about the system challenges that we all know we're facing, demand, access, and workforce,
05:47:58.000 remember the name My Happy Mind. We're here to support you. We're proven, cost-effective, evidencebacked, and we
05:48:04.958 can take massive pressure off the system and deliver a significant ROI in year.
05:48:10.000 But most importantly, we're supporting to help children be mentally healthy within school, within their communities.
05:48:17.040 Thank you. Brilliant.
05:48:22.080 And just under time, that's what I like. What you what you do is remarkable.
05:48:28.320 Thank you. It is the most important thing, isn't it? Um, you know, children's mental
05:48:34.320 health and well-being, getting it right. Any questions you'd like to have for Laura?
05:48:40.638 I've got one around mental health support teams. Um, so I know we're facing massive
05:48:47.360 shortages in terms of the actual mental health support teams and the amount of volume of work that's coming through. So
05:48:52.400 could you expand on where this fits in to that? Yeah, sure. So um, mental health support
05:48:57.520 teams, for those of you that don't know what they are, um, exist to support really that stage before children get to
05:49:02.638 the stage where they're being referred into specialist services. Um, and they have three core functions. um one of
05:49:07.840 which is to deliver something called the whole school approach which is essentially to help schools become mentally healthy which is basically what
05:49:14.080 we do. So where we're um partnering really effectively with systems is that we're delivering that component of the
05:49:19.520 mental health support team. Um but because we deliver via teachers rather than relying on a on a health care
05:49:24.878 workforce, we can just do it much quicker, much faster, and importantly much cheaper. Um, in the 10-year plan,
05:49:31.200 there's a goal that by 2930, every single school, um, in the country will have a mental health support team. Um,
05:49:37.200 but there's no extra money. And so, every time I talk to our commissioners about that, they kind of laugh and say, "How on earth are we going to deliver
05:49:42.958 that?" Um, and that's where we can come in and and support. Good. Thank you, Joe. Um,
05:49:48.878 any more? I've got I've got one quickly. Um, so I said something very nice and now I'm going to give you some other
05:49:54.240 feedback. Yeah. What do you want? What's your ask of this audience? have you come here just to tell them how it's wonderful what you
05:50:01.360 presented but make them do some work for you what do you want from them so my ask is that any of you who have a
05:50:06.878 role in or a contact in children young people's mental health um where you see your system is I'm seeing some nodding
05:50:12.400 heads which is always good um your system is right for doing something a bit differently but something that's very proven absolutely come grab me in
05:50:18.240 the break and I can um I can tell you more and your details are on the slide they absolutely are business cards as
05:50:23.360 well great what a great thing what a great Laura thank you so very much again obviously Taz, you're next, sir.
05:50:32.558 Four minutes. I need to plug in
05:50:57.440 Okay. Hello. Good afternoon everyone. My name is Taz Alderwood. I'm a very proud Leads Medical School graduate, West
05:51:04.240 Yorkshire GP. Um I'm also the CEO and founder of Doabode. Our vision simple to
05:51:11.040 help the NHS save lives by getting the right person to the right place at the right time delivering care closer to
05:51:17.360 home across urgent and community care. Believe it or not, staff are still using
05:51:24.000 spreadsheets, WhatsApp, siloed systems to deliver care. The result is delays
05:51:30.798 for patients, wasted staff time, and unnecessary hospital admissions.
05:51:36.558 This is the productivity challenge we're here to solve. Accelerating access, improving coordination, and empowering
05:51:44.000 care at home. Dockerode is a workforce coordination
05:51:49.760 platform. Think of it like an air traffic controller for urgent community care. One shared workflow powered by
05:51:56.638 real-time data. Frontline staff use a secure mobile app while coordinators
05:52:02.080 manage the service through a secure web portal. It brings together live information on staff skills,
05:52:08.080 availability, location, and service demand. So coordinators can see the whole picture and use resources
05:52:14.798 effectively. For leaders, it provides real-time visibility across services,
05:52:20.400 enabling proactive management and smoother crossboundary working
05:52:26.080 through real time highquality trusted data. Operational teams can see pressure
05:52:31.280 points early and respond instantly. For staff, it means fairer allocation,
05:52:37.680 loan worker protection and less duplication, building safety and workforce confidence. And at a system
05:52:43.760 level, it supports pathways like urgent community response, virtual wards, discharge to assess, reducing hospital
05:52:50.240 pressure by delivering more care at home. Docker mode doesn't replace what services do well. It helps them do it
05:52:56.958 more efficiently, more safely, and a greater scale. In North Central London, Docker Vot is
05:53:03.200 embedded across all the trusts as an IC exemplar, enabling systemwide coordination at scale. This shows what's
05:53:10.798 possible when coordination works without friction. The same approach can be replicated in all trusts and ICBS
05:53:16.958 nationally. The impact is proven in Camden. Productivity more than doubled. The
05:53:23.040 service capacity rose by more than 70%. Agency spend was slashed to zero. All
05:53:28.480 while staff confidence signals strong satisfaction. This was achieved without hiring
05:53:33.840 additional staff. It simply unlocked capacity already within the system. NHS
05:53:39.920 England now sites docker build at national best practice proof that it's part of the playbook for community care.
05:53:47.120 Independent modeling by UCL partners shows the scale of impact of dockabode with adopted nationally across all UCR
05:53:54.000 providers. over 575,000 additional urgent care contacts in the
05:53:59.120 community, almost 945,000 released non-elected bed days, and more
05:54:05.840 than 493 million pounds saved annually with an in-ear ROI of 16 pound for every
05:54:11.760 one pound spent on Docker mode. This is independently validated evidence that digital workforce coordination can
05:54:17.760 unlock NHS capacity at scale without additional workforce. Docker mode offers a systemwide command
05:54:24.798 center. One shared view of capacity, faster, safer triage, more productivity
05:54:30.798 with the same workforce. Live datadriven insights mean decisions are proactive, not reactive, giving back
05:54:38.480 time for staff to care. And finally,
05:54:44.400 the NHS needs to do more with the workforce we already have. Docker build is proven, it's scalable, and that it
05:54:51.920 can be a national solution that unlocks capacity and delivers care closer to home. We'd love to have the chance to
05:54:57.200 explore how this could support in your systems. Thank you very much. Look at that. Bang on.
05:55:06.160 And you've got some infectious disease today, so it wouldn't shake my hand. So, I'm not going to get close. Um, so my
05:55:13.920 question, I'm going to get to go. Where are you working in the north? Well, we were working in West Yorkshire,
05:55:19.040 right? Um, we actually heavily pivoted because we launched in GP out of ours in West Yorkshire, then in Manchester, then
05:55:25.600 Northwest Coast and then during co our whole use case died overnight.
05:55:31.280 So, we had to completely pivot. Where are you from? Did you tell me? From West Yorkshire for 20 years.
05:55:37.360 Yeah. Come on. Homegrown boy. Seen the results. Seen the results.
05:55:44.400 Any comments? Any questions? Cheers, Nicola. I was just going to say the same. Where are you working in the north? But you ask. Yeah. So,
05:55:50.798 I mean, I'll be honest with you, it's rare, but you know, I've had more traction in North London than in North. But uh we started in West Yorkshire,
05:55:57.360 grew across to the other side of the penines. But now our customer actually focus You're an export south of the wall,
05:56:03.520 aren't you? That a great northern export, but you need it here. Nicola, what do you think? It sounds great, doesn't it? Can he have a second? Can he
05:56:09.680 get a second date with you to find out what it's like in your area? Can you? And Richard, can he come as well? And
05:56:15.360 Phil, Richard has bought me from the very start to any other thoughts, questions you have,
05:56:21.680 lad. Uh has a question. Uh so great presentation you've you know described
05:56:29.040 the the coverage in the London and other areas are you fighting with the ICB
05:56:34.400 system similarly as Pog Dog is fighting or are you already at a stage where you can roll nationally somewhere across
05:56:40.400 I mean at this stage we're doing it trust by trust and where the ICBS have maturity to work with us a lot are in a
05:56:46.958 lot of state of flux with operational and structural changes but what we found especially in London I know um you know
05:56:52.718 supported by NIA was once one ICB did it and the the regional team brought
05:56:58.798 everyone together um you know we don't we don't have a sales and marketing team we're growing by word of mouth and
05:57:05.200 actually when they start talking to each other I think the carrot has now beginning to turn into a stick because
05:57:11.520 they've seen the evidence firsthand and and that's how we we've grown really and now you know we're outside of London
05:57:17.840 we're experiencing the same thing pretty much so I I think there's some help on the way which is the innovation compass and
05:57:25.040 passport. I know you won't be affected by the rulesbased pathway unless you're a medical device, a registered one, but
05:57:30.958 we are doing some things that well. So, we have listened to her. Did you want to say something quickly, Jack? Yeah, just really quickly. I think if
05:57:36.480 anyone in the room wants to talk about backfilling staff which can champion these innovations, I'd be very up for
05:57:42.878 that conversation because with Taz and Docker boat um the spread across London has been driven by one individual at
05:57:50.240 North Central London ICB um who's doing this out of goodness of their heart really. So it' be very interesting.
05:57:55.760 Great Northern innovation working in the south but not in the north. Go and have a seat. Well done.
05:58:01.440 Um you're next, sir. Four minutes.
05:58:14.718 Can you all hear me? Okay. Um
05:58:19.920 Oh, that works. Okay. My name is Umar Aed. I'm a NHS doctor. I'm on the clinical entrepreneurial program. We're
05:58:26.160 supported by the NIA, supported by SBRI, supported by NH, NIHR, supported by Innovate UK. So, thank you very much. uh
05:58:32.558 we are a health tech company uh that is working in primary care and so we're covering at the moment 44 million
05:58:39.120 patients in 38 ICs over uh 500 practices now uh as a CE marked medical device we
05:58:45.680 integrate with emisted system one and what we do is help turn this graph like this and move care towards the left
05:58:53.440 improving care in primary care looking after chronic diseases so okay I I I won't try and sell you this I think
05:58:59.600 we've talked enough about that but the reality is that although 90% of costs are chronic diseases, although 50% of
05:59:05.760 funding for primary care is towards proactive care, only 25% of capacity is
05:59:10.958 being used for primary for proactive care because we're spending all of our time looking after reactive care. And
05:59:16.400 the reality is that what we're asking GPS to do is to deal with a bunch of KPIs, national, local, regional, CQC,
05:59:22.798 IIAF, etc. whilst they're trying to deal with this demand. So, we're not really helping them do enough to actually
05:59:29.200 deliver what we're asking of them. Uh, and so what that means is that you've got 10% of the population overdue a test
05:59:35.520 we know they need, and we keep bringing them in, doing half the test they need, and then sending them back out again, and then trying to get them to come back
05:59:41.600 in again, which is not a good experience. And this is a product software issue, but it's also a coordination issue. And Abtrace solves
05:59:48.000 both. So what we do when we've integrated with these legacy electronic health records and I won't bore you with
05:59:53.200 that journey pulled out the data figured out what every single patient needs for every single chronic disease for
05:59:58.558 millions of patients on a daily basis and what we're able to give to the fingertips of every single clinician
06:00:04.240 whether they be a doctor or a nurse or an HCA is I know what this patient needs and I can make it happen. In fact will
06:00:11.360 make it happen. and it will find the people, tell them they need something and give them an appointment of their choice uh without anybody doing anything
06:00:18.000 at all. So what we do for the patient is we also tell them why why you need what you need and when you need it. So the
06:00:24.160 patient has control. They can submit their own blood pressure from home. They can go to the pharmacy. They can choose when things are convenient and we change
06:00:30.558 the patients experience of how they're getting care and get them more involved. And finally, we now work with payers,
06:00:36.080 ICBS. So we also give ICVS real-time insight as to who is getting care that you're paying for rather than waiting
06:00:42.638 for two years to get the impact of a new KPI. You get that impact that day and you get to see that across millions of
06:00:48.718 patients. So that's what we've built and we work across this entire system, entire stack in 38 ICs. So it's good for
06:00:55.440 the practices. They save money, they save time, they're able to do more, they're able to reduce increase their
06:01:00.878 income. The ICS's get total visibility about what the different PCMs practices down to an individual staff member, an
06:01:07.600 individual patient and you get these feedback loops. So these are not just dashboards telling you something is
06:01:12.718 wrong. When you notice that some population is not being addressed, there is a mechanism for increasing capacity
06:01:18.718 and actually doing something. So this is a functioning intelligent health system that is working across the country. Um
06:01:25.600 Tony's going to uh get upset with me with the slide because it's not readable. But uh what the slide is
06:01:30.798 trying to say is there's 39,000 heart attacks that we can stop over 10 years for an ICS. So it's not just about
06:01:36.638 efficiency, it's about changing the outcomes of these patients long term. Uh CKD prevalence, finding those people and
06:01:43.920 actually treating them. We've already this slide is out of date because we sign up 50 practices every week. We've
06:01:49.520 signed up 30 practices this week. It's Wednesday today I think. So we're we're terrible at reporting, but we're doing
06:01:55.120 50 deployments ourselves uh uh just every month at the moment. Uh and and so
06:02:00.240 so we're identifying new patients, getting them on the right drugs, monitoring them, uptitrating them all
06:02:07.360 automatically. Uh and it obviously has an impact on inequality. So this is smear data. The practices in green are
06:02:13.280 the ones using us. Their prevalence is much better. You better wrap it up. You're done. Well done. Well done. Good.
06:02:21.040 Um, I liken this to the Formula 1 teams, you
06:02:30.400 know, that have all that sensor data coming off the cars as they do laps. Like our patients are like Formula 1
06:02:36.718 cars doing the laps and we're just monitoring them. That's what Abrace is really. Isn't it amazing that you can do
06:02:42.958 that at scale for the population? I think what you do is wonderful, but you pitch too long. And what was your ask?
06:02:50.718 Uh what's our ask? You can see why he was worried about my feedback. So I don't know. It's just on.
06:02:55.840 But do you know that honesty is actually compassionate? I genuinely care about the companies and I think everyone here
06:03:03.280 does because we're not going to put our arm around you and tell you it's wonderful. We're just going to tell you how it is.
06:03:09.680 What do you want from this? Being very honest, we're doing very well. Uh and and I think we we are useful for ICS's and practices.
06:03:16.400 Actually, what's interesting is that although we've been had so much support from the NHS, our investors, we we've
06:03:22.400 we've been very lucky, secured lots of VC investment. Our investors are in Berlin, in Portugal, and in the US. So,
06:03:28.558 that's interesting to me. And I think that maybe we could do more. Well, we we'll be fine. We'll raise lots of money, but it would it would be nice to
06:03:35.040 be able to do that from the UK because we're very much one and from the NHS. It would be a great success story here,
06:03:41.360 wouldn't it? That's good. Any questions from anyone? Yes, Vlad. I have a question. And uh you managed to go through the four minutes without
06:03:47.680 mentioning the words artificial intelligence and machine learning. Does it mean that there is no artificial
06:03:54.480 intelligence and machine learning in your technology? And the second question, could it or should it be?
06:04:00.558 There is uh in other products that we're building, but not what I've shown you because what we want to do is to be
06:04:05.600 totally deterministic. So we don't want the thing to hallucinate and make incorrect assumptions. This is a
06:04:11.120 certified medical device that we spent years building. you can trace every single recommendation we make down to
06:04:16.878 the specific NHS guideline that we're making. So, we intentionally don't put AI in that decision-making engine. We do
06:04:23.360 for other things which which I haven't presented today. Right. Thank you. Nicola. Yeah.
06:04:28.798 Uh yeah, really really good. It was more of a um a comment rather than a question. So, we um we support something
06:04:34.638 called CDRC, clinical digital resources collaboration in the northeast. It's a locally born innovation. Um there is
06:04:41.600 significant synergies. It sits across EMIS and system one. There could be sort of lots of merit of us talking and
06:04:47.600 lessons learned, that kind of thing. CDRC's been integrated into our ICB, but I'm sure there's there's potential to
06:04:53.680 learn from one another. Look at that. I say to them, what you want what you want from a pitch is you want a second date and you've just got
06:05:00.400 one. All right, go and have a seat. Well done. Right, last start, Julian.
06:05:07.600 You get four minutes, sir.
06:05:21.600 Good afternoon. I'm Dr. Julian Nesbbit, a GP and founder of Dr. Julian. As we
06:05:27.520 all know, across the NHS, mental health services are under huge pressure. Patients face long waits, services are
06:05:34.638 fragmented, and clinicians are overwhelmed with admin. Too often people feel lost, stuck between services and
06:05:41.920 unable to get timely support. We need solutions that give people early access,
06:05:47.040 empower patients, and support overstretched NHS teams.
06:05:52.480 That's why I founded Dr. Julian. We actually started out as a therapy provider on a mission to improve access
06:05:58.400 to care and empower patients. But over the last nine years, we've built a comprehensive regulated digital platform
06:06:04.958 to support our own services. But this platform has now evolved into a modular infrastructure that supports clinicians,
06:06:12.480 engages patients through personalized dashboards, and captures outcome data in real time.
06:06:18.798 Alongside our technology, we provide direct clinical services through our network of over 400 qualified clinicians
06:06:25.760 covering the full mental health spectrum from talking therapies and counseling to psychology to ADHD services, maternity
06:06:33.360 services, eating disorder services, and child services. This means that we can give patients
06:06:38.718 immediate access to the help they need whilst also supporting NHS staff and well-being services.
06:06:48.638 We're not just a concept. We're already uh we're already live nationally. We've
06:06:54.320 delivered over 220,000 sessions ourselves and more than 1 million sessions through our tech licensing
06:06:59.520 model for the likes of Lincolnshshire, Oxley's, Milton Kees, Glostere, and lots of other NHS talking therapy services.
06:07:06.718 We support them in direct therapy delivery, improving outcomes for them and reducing their waiting lists as well
06:07:12.878 as saving them money. But from our technology perspective in Scotland, our platform is powering the national
06:07:18.718 digital front door for mental health with the SAMH charity up there, including digital triage, population
06:07:24.638 level and localized resource libraries, personalized self-help tools, appointment booking and tele medicine
06:07:30.480 functionality. And locally in Cumbria, our platform is being deployed as a digital social
06:07:35.760 prescribing tool supporting prevention and helping people back to work with localized and personalized self-help
06:07:42.878 tools through our resource library builder and and resource libraries.
06:07:48.160 It's also about to be deployed to support NHS staff across the region, giving them immediate access to therapy
06:07:53.760 with no waiting lists with our clinicians. And for national organizations like NHS Practitioner
06:07:59.440 Health and Vita Health Group, our platform is actually the backbone infrastructure that runs their entire service.
06:08:08.320 The key is flexibility. Systems can use as much or as little as of the platform as they need. Whether that be a
06:08:15.040 population level resource library for well-being and social prescribing that can actually be localized by region and
06:08:21.520 collect outcome data, an ADHD pre-screen to reduce inappropriate referrals, return to work
06:08:29.040 tools, or direct therapy access to our clinical services with no waiting list. Or it could even be the full
06:08:35.040 infrastructure with our case management, bookings, assessments, tele medicine, therapy tools, outcomes tracking, and a
06:08:41.440 lot more. So, we've gone from being a therapy provider to building our own technology
06:08:48.638 to now being the infrastructure for mental health delivery at scale. Our platform has been shown to hard did not
06:08:54.320 attend rates, hugely improve recovery rates, double engagement rates, and with the highest rated mental health service
06:09:00.240 on platforms like Trust Pilot from patient feedback. We've also delivered significant cost savings to the NHS.
06:09:07.200 We're proven, regulated, and already delivering nationally. And we're ready to continue scaling across the north of
06:09:13.040 England. So, we'd love to explore how we can plug into your priorities to make mental health care more accessible, more
06:09:18.878 efficient, and more effective for the populations you serve. Amazing. Well done. Don't sit down yet.
06:09:23.920 Don't sit down yet. Um, two seconds over. And is that a first you've done in
06:09:30.718 Cumbria in supporting the workforce in the NHS? uh we do in Lincolnshire and yeah we do
06:09:36.798 quite a few different NHS workforce support there on massive any questions from anyone on the panel
06:09:42.160 just tell them about the size of what's happening in Cumbria this contract you've just got
06:09:47.520 yes so yeah we're going to be delivering uh supporting NHS staff across the region and then I think what's
06:09:53.120 interesting with the technology it's over evolved over a lot of a long time how many staff are you going to be supporting
06:09:59.040 this hopefully the whole region so and then the patient population so you sort of use the tech in different ways. So
06:10:05.600 resource library and this so yeah and it it's depending on the budget it can be
06:10:11.360 as many staff want. Okay. And what do you want from this? We got T is going to have a question. What do you want from this lot?
06:10:17.520 Well, it's just we're there. Um and yeah, we'd love to there's lots that we can do. Um, we're doing it in lots of
06:10:23.840 different ways across the region, but uh, so yeah, come and talk to me if any of what I've said is in 220,000
06:10:30.798 appointments now through that platform. How amazing is that, Laura? How many were you? How many?
06:10:36.080 Million. A million. So, ours is a million on on the tech side. Competition. One question. Taz,
06:10:42.638 it's actually a comment. Um, a very close friend of mine who's a doctor was telling me about this platform and it
06:10:48.000 was a lifeline and I only recently found out it was your product actually, Dr. Julian and I haven't told you that yet.
06:10:53.040 So Oh, nice. Yeah, he's actually I think it's saving lives for healthare professionals. Thank you. That's very
06:10:58.400 I agree. And when you hear gole when you hear those stories we've heard
06:11:04.558 it in maternity from Gemma Paul who I think was here last year or the year before one of our fellows who said when
06:11:12.480 uh a woman goes to see her um GP and has a mental health issue it's going to be
06:11:18.558 six months before they can see someone. But with your platform you can see them
06:11:24.080 straight away. And it's also about underrepresented groups because if you've got people that speak different
06:11:29.200 languages and different cultures and you've got a much much wider network, you can actually get people that help because a lot of them weren't getting
06:11:34.718 the help because they they didn't want to talk to someone of that wasn't of their own language or culture. So we were able to bring them together.
06:11:40.718 Okay. Well then go look. So thank you very much to all our pictures
06:11:47.760 and I hope you've seen that theme of how we're it's digital.
06:11:52.798 uh it's going out into the community and getting that shift and it's been about prevention and maximizing what we do as
06:12:00.080 well as productivity and economic growth. One last thing, any last one thought you would just like to leave or
06:12:06.558 one ask any of you have for our audience here? Do you don't have to have today?
06:12:13.280 Yeah. Uh I've got one. Um, it's been consistently mentioned
06:12:19.040 throughout today that as a system we're not very good at picking out what's working across the system. Um, that's
06:12:25.760 what we're here for. That's what the NIA is for. Um, and we're working really closely with 15 health innovation
06:12:31.200 networks to make that happen. So, speak to us, check out our website, you can see 53 things that are working across
06:12:36.558 the system right now. And Jack offers free therapy sessions for companies was the other thing. Nicola, anything you
06:12:42.638 want to add? We've covered it. Vlad, there's a good one. Uh, as my company reps, uh, we're always looking for
06:12:49.840 partnerships. Okay? So, please approach me if you think you want to try to
06:12:55.520 actually do health checks, deliver health checks in a way that you have never done before. We are there for
06:13:00.558 that. Brilliant. Thank you very much. Um, so thank you to our panel and I get one last ask because I'm the last one to
06:13:06.958 speak. The clinical entrepreneur program is opening for applications in November.
06:13:12.000 I think third or fourth of November it's open for the whole month. If you work in the National Health Service and even if
06:13:18.400 you're at the very start of your journey, you don't have to be so mature to go on the NI thing because for us
06:13:24.160 it's about developing the individual and the human being the leader of the future to go on and work with our NI to work
06:13:31.680 with our hins to help transform them. Have a look at it nhsc.com. Thank you very much.
06:13:41.280 Thanks Tony and thanks panelists. So uh time for me to introduce or welcome back
06:13:47.680 um to the stage our final panel chair. Um you may not know that actually uh my
06:13:54.240 tenure as vice chair and Richard's as chair Batman and Robin is actually
06:13:59.280 rapidly coming uh to an end. When we do this next time there will be a new
06:14:05.040 superhero stood here in this spot. So, I thought it would be appropriate that we
06:14:10.160 um acknowledge uh how the network has advanced under Richard's leadership and
06:14:15.760 the contribution that he's made during his time as chairman. So, when we welcome him back, can I ask you to give
06:14:21.680 him a special warm round of applause and a mark of your appreciation? Richard,
06:14:27.520 over to you.
06:14:33.920 Thanks, Phil. That's lovely. Right back at you, Robin. Um right um it's the last
06:14:39.520 session. Thank you for bearing with us. This means that you are either absolutely on tender hooks for this last session or
06:14:46.320 you recognize as free drinks afterwards. Um either way I'm delighted that you're still with us. Thank you for that. Um
06:14:53.040 unfortunately as you can say Lucy Chapel is down on list here. Lucy can't be with us today but she was absolutely adamant
06:14:59.040 that she wanted to contribute to our session today. So she has sent us a short video. So, we're going to play the
06:15:06.000 video first before I get my panel on stage. So, cue Lucy. Hello.
06:15:12.480 Hello. It is a pleasure to join you virtually for the Health Innovation North Conference, an event that reflects
06:15:18.320 the energy, ambition, and collaborative spirit driving innovation across our health and care system. My name is Lucy
06:15:25.600 Chapel, chief scientific adviser at the Department of Health and Social Care and the CEO of the National Institute for
06:15:31.280 Health and Care Research. As a researcher myself, I've seen at firsthand the power of the Hins in
06:15:38.240 spreading innovation through the roll out of placental growth factor testing. That final stage of implementation was
06:15:45.040 what took a test from being written about in a trial to being used in maternity units across the country,
06:15:51.200 making a difference to the lives of thousands of pregnant women. At the NIHR, our mission is clear to
06:15:58.878 improve the health and wealth of the nation through research. As the research arm of the Department of
06:16:05.600 Health and Social Care, the NIHR proudly supports the bridge between discovery
06:16:10.638 and delivery. We champion innovation as one of NIHR's four eyes alongside
06:16:16.160 investment, impact, and inclusion. The tenure health plan was published in
06:16:21.600 July this year with a strong future-facing focus. It gives us an opportunity to design and deliver
06:16:27.600 research that has tangible outcomes for patients and the public and then to develop and deploy innovations to power
06:16:34.320 the health and care system of the future through popular programs such as I fori
06:16:39.760 or invention for innovation. The NIHR funds the development and evaluation of promising technologies and
06:16:46.000 interventions. And our network of 14 health tech research centers is dedicated to the de
06:16:52.400 development, testing, and evaluation of innovative health technologies in conjunction with industry partners. The
06:16:59.680 HRC's provide expertise to work collaboratively with the wider commercialization and adoption landscape
06:17:05.200 to get new technologies to patients, the public, and the health and social care system.
06:17:12.000 The NHR biomedical research centers catalyze the development of new therapeutic interventions, diagnostic
06:17:18.320 tests, digital innovations and devices, testing what works to improve patient
06:17:23.360 outcomes. We recognize however that we need to go further and faster to speed up adoption
06:17:29.200 at pace and scale. The recent applied research collaboration commission has a strengthened remitt to respond
06:17:35.520 nationally to meet the biggest systemwide challenges. We are providing greater resource and expertise to
06:17:42.160 support implementation of effective interventions and models of care into practice, working closely with health
06:17:48.638 innovation networks and other partners. Next year, a new ARC network will
06:17:54.718 provide strategic and operational coordination, optimizing synergies across the infrastructure, and
06:18:01.200 facilitating national links with key partners, including companies in the life sciences sector and the health
06:18:06.958 innovation networks. The NHR also offers expertise and join
06:18:12.320 up across the system working closely with the health innovation networks to provide support in regulation, evidence
06:18:19.200 generation and implementation to help innovators navigate the complex journey from research towards adoption.
06:18:26.718 Your networks are vital to embedding innovation in the health care system. The joint working we've seen from the
06:18:33.120 Northern Health Innovation Networks on the digital north accelerated program to address problems in elective recovery
06:18:39.920 and patient flow is testament to the role that you play in improving patient outcomes through innovation.
06:18:48.000 The government recently published its life sciences sector plan where it committed to deliver an NIHR R&D
06:18:54.798 innovation catalyst which will pull through innovations developed by partners such as Innovate UK that meet
06:19:02.000 the demands of the health and care system. As part of this, the NHR will provide
06:19:07.920 R&D funding throughout the translational phases of research if key milestones are met as well as providing comprehensive
06:19:15.520 wraparound support to connect innovators to test beds, venture capital funds,
06:19:21.440 regulators, procurement processes and provide support for commercialization.
06:19:26.638 We know that innovation is not always easy and that scaling up remains one of the toughest challenges. As a clinical
06:19:33.760 trialist and researcher, I found the most vital component to be effective and impactful innovation is co-design.
06:19:41.840 I found it invaluable to engage with patients, clinicians across the workforce and commissioners early, not
06:19:47.920 just at the end. Their valuable insights are critical to shaping innovations,
06:19:53.280 generating the right evidence, and getting ready for adoption. At the NHR, we're proud to work
06:19:59.680 alongside you in the health innovations networks as you develop innovations that support the 10-year health plans three
06:20:06.000 big shifts. Moving care from hospitals to communities, from analog to digital,
06:20:11.360 and sickness to prevention. Ultimately, innovation has the central goal of driving improvements to the
06:20:18.400 lives of patients and the public and the work that is being done by the health innovation networks is crucial to this.
06:20:25.680 Thank you and I hope that I can be with you in person on another occasion
06:20:31.440 on behalf of everyone. Um she was absolutely desperate to be here and it just um it couldn't work unfortunatistically. So thank you for
06:20:37.280 that. Um right final session as promised. So could I invite to the stage my lovely panel um barely sat here. He's
06:20:45.280 very close. Ros Ram Nathan and where's Andrew?
06:20:52.480 Oh there he is. if you take the uh traditional boy band
06:20:58.400 seats that would be lovely. So while the pound of this just a word of introduction so today um we've heard
06:21:06.638 from several national leaders you can't get really more national than some of
06:21:11.680 the leaders we've heard from today particularly Jim we've heard from some of our regional leaders we've heard obviously from our health innovation
06:21:17.280 networks crucially we've heard from our innovators we've heard from patients we've heard from frontline clinicians
06:21:22.400 and managers we've heard from ecosystem facilitators and many more people um I
06:21:29.440 think some of the things we've heard today. We've heard a lot about what makes success work, what are the secret
06:21:35.120 ingredients behind the successes. We've also heard quite a lot of honesty about, you know, where things haven't worked,
06:21:40.240 what the lessons learned has to be. But I think one of the things we've very very much heard is innovation is
06:21:45.360 absolutely a team sport and that's what this uh final session is about. We all have a role to play. So we really wanted
06:21:52.400 to bring the government in the form of Ross um and uh our hins, our frontline
06:21:59.840 leadership, our ecosystem facilitators and our and our innovators together to
06:22:05.120 talk particularly about how do we ensure that alignment works when has it know
06:22:11.920 give us examples of when it's worked before and let's think about how we can do more to join the dots in the future.
06:22:17.120 So before we get into the debate, I just want to ask the panel to briefly introduce themselves and just give us a
06:22:22.958 little bit about who you are, but crucially I think um just add a flavor to I suppose your starting position
06:22:30.400 statement on on this world of alignment all the way from national to front line and back up again. And shall we start at
06:22:37.280 this event with with Andrew? Yeah, sure. Great. Thanks, Richard. Um so I'm Andrew
06:22:43.040 Edmonds. I'm the innovation director in North Umbrea Healthcare. Uh we are um
06:22:48.480 acute community primary care um uh uh services across Northland and North
06:22:54.000 Tinside. Um our old boss is now the boss um which brings both uh uh benefits and
06:23:00.878 risks um I should say. Um uh and uh I guess we have a range of different you
06:23:06.878 know innovated innovative arms. um you know it ranges from I think something
06:23:12.160 closer towards the higher end um to something that is a bit more um uh you
06:23:17.280 know well further away from the higher end I don't want to call it the lower end um but uh you know that includes um
06:23:23.760 um some of our commercial activities as well um and I think Jim said it um earlier and we'll maybe get into it a
06:23:29.360 little bit in the discussion um everyone has got a role to play um there are some common themes I think within that in
06:23:35.280 terms of pushing forward the risk appetite in terms of making decisions that potent potentially feel a bit more risky. Um, and quite a lot of the time,
06:23:43.280 you know, I see Nick's in the front row and actually we're talking about the same company in the same way, um, or the
06:23:48.878 same partner in, you know, in the same way. But there's also loads of examples where that's not the case. And there might be really good reasons for that.
06:23:55.760 Um, but I think it's just about being honest and actually working out where that reason is, you know, it's a real
06:24:01.680 reason rather than something that just comes from, you know, I'm a bit pissed off with Nick this week or something like that. So yeah, that's where I am.
06:24:09.120 Thanks Andrew for that. Let's move down to Ben. Thanks. So I'm Ben Bridgewwater. I'm the
06:24:14.638 chief executive at Health Innovation Manchester. So we are very proud to be a member of the Health Innovation Network.
06:24:20.320 Very proud to be a member of the Northern Health Innovation Network. Um uh but we're also a wider partnership
06:24:26.718 between local government, the universities in Greater Manchester, um industry and the NHS. uh and we work
06:24:34.080 hard to try and understand what's going on in terms of national policy but also try and understand what's going on with
06:24:40.798 respect to local policy and particularly how the devolution agenda which is long and deep in Greater Manchester is
06:24:48.000 creating opportunities for local people. Uh so a lot of the challenges uh that I
06:24:53.440 have which makes my job particularly interesting I think uh and uh the reason why I have no hair left at all is we're
06:25:00.480 trying to actually bring together those policies which come out from the center and make them make sense at the local at
06:25:07.840 the local level to add benefit to local pat to patients citizens the greater
06:25:13.600 Manchester economy and ensure that the greater Manchester economy punches its weight in terms of contributing to UK
06:25:19.600 PLC. And actually it's that alignment which is some of the hard stuff and I do think that we can probably do it better if we
06:25:26.160 get our heads around it properly. Yeah. Thanks D. Ram. Hi everyone. My name is Ram Raj Raman.
06:25:32.160 I'm the healthcare and life sciences lead for Quantexa. So um I know one of our founders was on the panel before but
06:25:38.798 as a reminder we are a British scaleup. Um, so we link and contextualize
06:25:44.480 complex uh siloed data at scale to create effectively a patient or a
06:25:50.240 citizen 360 to try better decisions. Um, I've been I've been lucky to be part of
06:25:56.000 a number of innovations, some successful and some not in the NHS over the last two decades. Used to head up GL Care's
06:26:02.000 command center business which is up and running in Bradford teaching hospital driving real-time predictive patient intelligence there. uh also worked with
06:26:08.638 NHS England on uh the FTP on on Palunteer on the system coordination
06:26:13.920 center a few years ago and hopefully driving some more innovation through um through Quantexa. So uh in this
06:26:21.440 conversation hopefully what I want to kind of drive out is four I guess four ingredients I would say helps and
06:26:28.718 supports uh innovation when policy the problem statement uh clinical
06:26:34.480 sponsorship and data when all those four come together in harmony it's I think where the true magic happens.
06:26:41.920 Thanks Rob Nathan. Hello everyone. I'm Nathan Barry. I'm the head of collaboration and health tech lead at
06:26:48.480 Nexus, which is the innovation community at the University of Leeds. So we have about 130 members of that community of
06:26:57.280 which over half about 60 to 70 so roughly half um are within the health
06:27:03.200 tech space. And my role, my team's role is to work with them, understand their
06:27:08.798 challenges and help them navigate the complex landscapes that exist, not just
06:27:14.878 into the NHS, but for these companies, even though we're based at the University of Leeds, only about 15% are
06:27:20.638 spinouts. The rest are all companies that have come to the university, come to the region to say, how do we how do
06:27:27.680 we access the the skills and the the expertise? So when we look at it in that
06:27:32.718 respect, it it's into the university as well as well as into the NHS. Prior to joining the universities, I worked for a
06:27:40.000 small company. So I understand the challenges of finding the right person. And I think that's uh when we talk about
06:27:46.240 policy and the announcements and where they come from uh from central government, sometimes that they're not
06:27:52.958 they're policy announcements, but there's no detail behind it. But the innovators, they hear them, they come to
06:27:58.320 us and they say, "Right, how do we how do we get in there? How do we solve this? We've got a technology to solve this." And then there's a frustration
06:28:05.440 there because the local NHS, they see the the the local NHS as the barrier, but the the NHS, the services are still
06:28:12.638 trying to get their heads around what these policy announcements mean, how they deal with them, how they how they
06:28:17.920 service the patients. how we we smooth out some of those those those bumps in
06:28:23.040 the road I think is is something I'd like to get my head around. Brilliant. Thanks, Nathan. And finally, Ross.
06:28:28.718 Good to see you all. I'm uh Ross Campion. I'm the director of the Office for Life Sciences, which is a trilateral
06:28:34.160 unit in the UK government. Uh so we report into the Department of Health, uh Department of Science, and the Department of Business. What I think
06:28:40.400 that means having heard everybody on this panel is that I'm the bad guy, which was really not the pitch I was
06:28:47.040 told. So that's the other and I find deeply upsetting. Um but um and Ben I
06:28:54.638 thought we were friends but apparently no longer. Um but anyway um uh but in
06:29:01.600 terms of sort of my my sort of uh take on this. So um I of course recognize some of the picture that's been set out
06:29:08.240 already and for me the key thing that um uh needs to happen is to get the right sort of push and pull between the
06:29:14.798 systems. So as we um uh looked at um doing our work um to develop the life sciences sector plan and the life and
06:29:20.878 the 10ear health plan we you know this wasn't a sort of some random person in ivory tower sort of coming up with their
06:29:27.280 own ideas like we did all of the policy work within task and finish groups which involved many sort of people from
06:29:32.958 industry many people from the NHS many people from from um the hins in fact uh John Sadal from um uh Cornwall um and
06:29:40.160 the southwest um uh chaired one of our groups so for me there is something about making sure that we get the
06:29:45.600 co-creation right because otherwise you will have slightly bonkers things coming out. Um uh and then I think the second
06:29:51.760 thing for me is really making sure that we are listening to the demand signals that are coming out from the front line
06:29:58.718 as much as um so listening to those um within government um rather than sort of
06:30:03.920 being too sort of push. So those are sort of two things from my perspective. Thank you Ro and staying with the bad
06:30:09.280 guy. Staying with Ros for a second. Actually, you know, you're definitely not the bad guy, by the way. You're an absolute hero for us in terms of
06:30:14.400 innovation, adoption. So, so, um, but this is a two-way conversation. This is
06:30:20.000 actually not a conversation about how the front line sends a message to the national to say this is what we needs to
06:30:25.520 happen better. There's also, I think, a very clear conversation about what is it that we can be doing better from our
06:30:32.160 regional and frontline level to help governments, wider government, not just ours, in policy formation. So you talked
06:30:38.718 a little bit about the the the structure you put in place for the tenure health plan for the life science sex plan. If
06:30:44.878 you could wave that wand, you know, what would you wish to see here engage with
06:30:50.478 at frontline level that would make your job easier to spread innovation? Um so maybe um a couple of thoughts on
06:30:57.200 that. So I mean the first and and somebody referred to this earlier like you can end up in a world where policy
06:31:02.718 gets set in London and then it it feels like there's a gap and everybody's like gosh like how do we fill it? So one of
06:31:08.160 the and I'm very conscious of that as a risk and so one of the things that um we did with the life science sector ban was to be really clear about what good would
06:31:14.718 look like who the SRO's were and then to give one person accountability for you are going to go and do this but we
06:31:20.798 expect you to do it with the system not to the system. So in part there is for me um I I hope we've set up our system
06:31:27.600 um in a way that um uh policies and and the policy um pull through from the life sciences sector plan um will be starting
06:31:34.798 from a place of clarity on what good will look like but also clarity on partnership in terms of um uh uh pulling
06:31:40.958 through. Um and a decent example of that is um in one of the initiatives that uh we included uh the regional health
06:31:46.798 innovation zones where um absolutely um uh the policy is not um uh sort of uh
06:31:52.958 nailed down. This is about a concept of giving sort of greater freedom at a local level. Um permission to permission
06:31:59.520 to break all the rules to be able to um uh help um help get innovation pulled through and that is something that that
06:32:06.000 we only can do with in partnership uh with all of you in policy development because um frankly you are the people
06:32:11.520 who know what the rules are that need to be broken. Um so um if I could wave a magic wand, it is partly what I have
06:32:18.478 sort of I hope I've set in train. Um but I think the other thing and Ben and I were talking about this um just before
06:32:24.240 this session um is hearing sort of like an even louder voice um uh into government um on what what you think
06:32:31.920 where you think we should be really prioritizing where you think the focus should be. There was a slightly dispiriting moment where Ben said
06:32:37.760 sometimes your um their steers come come through and they're a bit bonkers and I was like not the ones that we put out as
06:32:44.878 my heart sort of slowly broke. Um but like really um or indeed quickly broke, let's be honest. Um but but like really
06:32:52.320 sort of making sure that um uh we are having an honest dialogue because like there's no you know the worst thing in
06:32:58.478 the world is some random in government comes up with an idea and and you don't say that's a terrible idea, don't do it.
06:33:04.080 So be a bit more demanding of us um and a bit more open and honest. That's really good Ross. Thank I was at
06:33:10.240 the launch of our local growth plan for South York last week and I can't remember who's talking about it but the old joke of uh you know the worst words
06:33:16.958 to hear are I'm here from government I'm here to help. Um was it a p I think may use as a punch line not about OS
06:33:23.360 absolutely not. I fear we should come to Ben just like what is this new
06:33:29.440 I think that's I mean I thank you for my support.
06:33:35.360 Yeah. Help me out, Ben. I know. I think I think I think I think it is right that you come to me now. So,
06:33:42.320 can I can I can I fully and formally and humbly if in any way I've upset Ross in
06:33:49.040 terms of my opening statement, I regret it deeply and it wasn't what I meant. But I and what I would also say in this
06:33:56.000 and I think this is the kind of key point is if you look at some of the things that we are most proud of in Greater Manchester, it's when there has
06:34:02.958 been absolute alignment between what Ros and her team are trying to achieve and
06:34:08.160 what we are trying to achieve. And actually there is inherently a a a friction sometimes between having a
06:34:15.040 devolution agenda and having stuff that gets run from the center. And the way you get around that is you talk about it
06:34:21.280 and you find a way through. But we've got a number now of absolutely fantastic examples. Some of the things that we've
06:34:27.440 pursued and actually OS have really come in behind and we've got them over the line. And these are not small things.
06:34:32.478 These are massive big ticket items. Some of the things that actually uh OS have
06:34:38.320 done and they've asked for our help and we've given a little bit just a little little bit of a shove at the end to help it get over the line. Again, big ticket
06:34:45.040 items. some of the things that OS have just done and we go wow that's fantastic and I think this otherwise some of the
06:34:50.798 stuff that we've done vice versa but it does work well but I think my point is to actually get those synergies you've
06:34:58.000 actually got to work at it and recognizing you've got to have the conversations there isn't any attention
06:35:03.520 in it you work those tensions through but the more you align the priorities the bigger prizes you can get and the
06:35:09.600 quicker that you can get them and again I formally apologize if that didn't come through in my opening statement and Ben now we finished making fun of
06:35:15.920 Ros. I I was hoping that you and Ros between you could just tell us a little bit about the story of some of that alignment through the Eli Liy journey if
06:35:23.120 possible. Maybe start with you Ben and then maybe Ross can add. But I think that's a great example of how when it
06:35:29.200 works it works well. Yeah, thanks. So, so um
06:35:35.440 I I don't think you had to be uh Nostradamus four years ago to work out there were
06:35:42.000 some new therapies coming over the line which were going to be big ticket items in driving population health and we did
06:35:48.638 a horizon scan. We have some data assets that we spent a long time building which we think are really kind of relevant to
06:35:55.680 the global life sciences industry. We have some other things that we do which we also think are relevant to the global life sciences industry particularly
06:36:01.840 about pathway reimagining. So we looked at who's got a rich pipeline
06:36:08.478 um who's got a culture that we think is compatible where might there be some big
06:36:13.520 opportunities and we started to work on this a long time ago to try and build the opportunity of the future and um we
06:36:21.120 have some fantastic team and two of them in the front and we have a methodology understand reimagine implement and so we
06:36:27.360 wanted to understand the obesity problem so we worked with Eli Lily to properly understand the obesity problem who's got
06:36:32.958 it what are trends. How is that segmented by this that and the other? Number one. Number two, what are the existing obesity pathways? Who are they
06:36:39.920 provided for? Are they effective? What's their geographical scope? What's their capacity? And then thirdly, what are the
06:36:45.120 economic consequences of obesity? So, we really built that understand um landscape uh in partnership co-created
06:36:53.040 with with our colleagues at Eli Liy. We then said, okay, the next step in that is then reimagine how you going to do things differently. And actually out of
06:36:59.200 that felt uh the fact that actually there was some further real world evidence stuff that was required which
06:37:04.478 actually we are quite well configured to be able to do in in in Greater Manchester and they were looking for a place with a public policy around
06:37:10.798 obesity a public player model a place with mature data assets and some people who could deliver some stuff and they
06:37:17.200 kind of ended up landing landing the trial with us. I can say this can't without getting problems with
06:37:22.400 compliance. So that's what was my story on that. But actually a lot through the
06:37:27.760 the the great work of Jay Hampton sitting in the front row here as an absolute superstar. She was developing
06:37:32.878 all these relationships into OS and in parallel but absolutely connected that there was a whole bunch of work with
06:37:38.958 Ross and her team which which did which came together and it was those coming together which got everything over the
06:37:44.160 line at the end. Uh hand over to you Ross. I mean you have told the story very beautifully. I mean we also spotted
06:37:50.798 obesity was going to be the thing. um uh great mind sink alike um uh and had also
06:37:56.320 been uh we'd had a uh in the life sciences vision. So um the previous government strategy we'd said we want to
06:38:02.320 take um sort of fairly radical approach to um uh a few different disease areas, one of which was obesity. Bring together
06:38:09.360 government industry, the NHS uh to try and uh look at solving them differently. And of course for obesity we could tell
06:38:14.400 that the real problem was not going to be the invention of medicines because they've been invented but was going to be how you actually give them to
06:38:19.760 patients. Um uh so we had um been working with um uh our externally
06:38:25.040 appointed chair um uh who' been brewing up conversations with all the companies who are in the um uh in the obesity
06:38:31.920 space. Um and uh partly inspired by their conversation with with Manchester
06:38:38.320 uh we we then began a sort of broader conversation about the partnership um uh that with a broader partnership that we
06:38:44.000 could have um and this ended up with with um what was a very nice um sort of multi- sort of limbmed partnership um
06:38:50.400 which had um the Manchester trial is a a core component uh but also um a broader national program run by innovate um
06:38:57.200 which is I think still open at the moment which is about um uh uh testing how to give um obesity medicines to
06:39:03.280 patients um safely um on the NHS. So this is a sort of total package then I think um uh be became a partnership that
06:39:11.200 Lily couldn't resist and I would say that I don't think that either ele well my personal view is that neither element
06:39:16.638 would have necessarily got over the line without the other bit. Um uh and I mean I should say uh since uh this is
06:39:23.360 probably one of the last times I'll see Jay that um uh there is uh Jay has done and Ben and team team have done such a
06:39:29.200 fantastic job um from an OS perspective and you have such a large number of fans
06:39:34.400 in my organization. It's super sweet. Um so but like it it is sort of the epitome of demand signaling um uh horizon
06:39:41.760 scanning and then partnership which frankly is what we need to do if we wish to align and accelerate. Yeah. Brilliant. Thank you both. Um,
06:39:48.718 Andrew, can I come to you please? We heard from your old boss and new boss, I
06:39:53.760 guess, Jim, earlier today. Um, about the lack of bandwidth in operational management, you know, obvious statement,
06:40:00.798 but worth saying. um as an innovation leader in the trust, uh I guess just what is the the ratio
06:40:10.000 almost of I suppose your attention to build it right here versus look out and
06:40:16.478 look up about what else is happening out there which may be useful you know where do you put your time
06:40:22.080 and and also not just your time but the time of your clinical entrepreneurs innovators others within the trust yeah yeah yeah um yeah I mean it's it's
06:40:31.200 tricky And I guess there are, you know, these things slightly go in cycles over the um over the year. If you try to have
06:40:36.718 conversation with anyone clinical in December, January and February, uh it's not going to go very far. Um
06:40:42.160 understandably so as well, I think. Um so um I think and and you know, I look
06:40:47.840 at our innovation team as it were. There's three people in the trust who have innovation in their title. Most of
06:40:53.120 them have other things attached to it as well. Um so there's even a kind of ring fencing issue within people who you know
06:40:59.760 are are there to focus on innovation. I sort of feel like we try and focus on two things. One is the funnel. How are
06:41:07.120 we funneling in the right ideas and some of them could be things that we've developed you know internally within the
06:41:12.558 um with within our people. Um and some of them will of course be external. And then there's the pathway about how do we
06:41:18.320 make that you know happen and how do we take it how do we take it forward. Um, we try not to use the word process
06:41:24.160 because it sort of turn it turns people off a little bit. Um, I think that a lot
06:41:31.440 of the time and look there's alignment across organizations, but there's also alignment within organizations, across
06:41:36.638 professions. I was at our senior nursing group last Thursday. They're all lovely.
06:41:42.000 But they still have some pretty tricky questions if you want to extend something and roll it out and it's got anything to do with care. Rightly so. um
06:41:49.680 especially if it includes some form of technology that's new and a little bit different. So people's risk appetites
06:41:55.360 within the organization and across the professions will be very different as well. Um we do try and you know create I
06:42:02.718 guess and it always sounds a bit na but that sort of rising tide um and actually you're able to convince and create you
06:42:09.520 know turn people into you know a net adopter a net a net promoter um and uh
06:42:16.000 and and take that forward. I think when it comes to between organizations and I
06:42:21.280 don't know whether it necessarily fitted within the Eli Liy example but often and I was maybe thinking about it in the in
06:42:27.600 in Tony's session Tony and the entrepreneurs um but uh uh there's
06:42:33.680 something about where the risk sits so who the contracting organization is.
06:42:38.798 We don't think about this a lot but if something god forbid something goes wrong like who's going to prison
06:42:44.080 basically and a lot of the time it's colleagues towards the front line and that's why the risk appetite is there
06:42:50.240 from be you know to to to start with and I do think if there's something about
06:42:56.320 like stretching that out or sharing that and you know taking that ultimate risk
06:43:01.520 uh between the organizations cross um across hins with national bodies as well um I think that's where actually we
06:43:07.680 would improve improve some of that improve some of that alignment. It's hard to do when ultimately a contract has to land with a particular
06:43:13.600 organization, especially obviously if it's an external partnership. Um but yeah, we think about prison more than
06:43:20.160 more than others potentially. Yeah. No, quite rightly. Nathan, I come to you. I thought you had a really
06:43:25.360 interesting point in your opening kind of gambit around this notion of the
06:43:30.638 signal from the center, the flare from White Hall, however you want to describe it goes up. You know, we're all doing, you know, neighborhood health now or,
06:43:36.718 you know, three shifts, what it may be, absolutely the right policy direction to set and yet the system hasn't really
06:43:43.840 been readed and pitch rolled and yet the flood of innovations and innovators who get really excited by that because they
06:43:50.080 genuinely believe they've got something to help comes to us. They come to you. I was just really struck by your point
06:43:55.840 about you know how do we how do we get that kind of staging
06:44:01.280 better aligned and timed so that actually the system is ready for the innovations as they come forward and
06:44:07.840 you're not almost it feels like you're almost holding back a horde of eager innovators who've got something to do
06:44:13.680 something to say about the problems that government have said they're really interested in you know any what would make life easier from your perspective
06:44:19.680 in terms of that problem that you set out I think we we'd use the example of Eli by Lily as the demand signaling. I think
06:44:26.240 for pharmaceuticals there is you know what's coming down the line five eight years in advance because they publicize
06:44:33.040 information you can you can find that information with tech solutions with htech medtech there's not that same
06:44:39.200 demand signaling we can't map it as successfully I don't think yet and so
06:44:44.400 people have ideas but they're they're based on what the problem is now whereas pharmaceutical companies not only are
06:44:50.958 they a brand name that people recognize so they get traction through that they have they have a a lot of access to what
06:44:58.798 the what the needs of society are, the the health economics, the the different change in the population health changes
06:45:04.958 that small companies don't. And I I I think I I'm sat here look looking at it and thinking it's great to say that we
06:45:12.080 we signal this and we we've got the the support and we can do health economics and look at the demand and say right
06:45:18.160 this is going to be the problem but when it comes to a small company they don't have the the same luxury of that. So
06:45:24.958 when I'm I'm sat here, I'm thinking I'm representing the the 70 companies that I've got and to find a clinical champion
06:45:31.920 to find someone who can help with the population health data to then fund it and build all that in is a huge
06:45:38.160 challenge for a startup and a scaleup. And I keep looking over at Rory, sorry Rory, for calling you out. Uh I had a
06:45:43.520 company join us um uh a few couple of years ago now. And I was just saying to
06:45:48.638 Rory earlier, if it hadn't been for them being signposted towards coming through the system and me knowing that I could
06:45:54.478 email Rory and say, "Look, there's this company. This is what they're trying to solve. Can you can you give me any
06:45:59.920 advice?" And he said, "Don't send them anywhere else. I want them." And it would have taken them 12, 18 months to
06:46:05.440 work through the system to find the answer to find that person. And and that is that is one of the biggest challenges
06:46:11.040 not just when the messaging comes out from government but these people with the ideas how do they navigate that
06:46:17.120 system and if if if there's no help there then it becomes a real real barrier and we will lose innovation if I
06:46:25.040 as I say I used to work um outside the NHS and I think if I had at at a farmer
06:46:31.600 company other pharmaceutical companies are available um they on my email address I'd have got a lot more traction
06:46:38.320 in the small startup I worked for getting through the door and I think that's one of the the biggest challenges
06:46:43.360 faced by by the innovators. Thanks Nathan. Roie, do you want to come in on that? Yeah, I mean I thought it was um agreed
06:46:50.478 with loads um that you said there I thought was um incredibly interesting. I think so. I think we should we we are
06:46:57.280 you know um kidding ourselves if we don't sort of recognize that serendipity plays an unfortunately large sort of um
06:47:04.240 uh role in whether an innovation is successful or not. Um and in my view, you can take that in sort of one of two
06:47:10.798 ways. You can say, "Dear God, that's terrible. We need to make sure that we're taking a systemwide approach that is really finding ways of ushering in
06:47:17.280 the right um technologies into the system." Or we can say that is the way of the world. Let us make sure that we
06:47:23.440 are as wellorked and well understanding um of the the of the system as we can so that we can make those connections. And
06:47:29.760 of course, in my like unsurprisingly, I think both of those are the right answer. like I absolutely think we need
06:47:35.440 to have um a much better approach to um supporting um innovations more generally. That is why you see um our
06:47:42.958 system um their government is um uh putting uh more investment, more focus into things like the innovate programs,
06:47:49.040 the clinical like all of the systems that we put in place but like serendipity will always play a role and
06:47:54.320 I think it is really incumbent on all of us to make sure that we are sort of helping serendipity work right. So a
06:48:00.878 sort of very a different example of a partnership that we we forged in OS um was with um Oxford Nanopore. Um uh and
06:48:08.718 that was definitely a serendipity um uh thing where uh I sort of put together
06:48:14.000 that we had a sort of set of concerns around um uh pandemic preparedness and
06:48:19.200 um uh surveillance um uh uh from a sort of government perspective. And I I had a UK company that really could do with
06:48:25.200 selling their stuff. like proving that their their technology worked in the NHS in ICUs. Finding those a way of sort of
06:48:32.080 bringing those sort of two things together has now meant that we have a national sort of roll out um in um uh an
06:48:40.000 R&D basis um which is like quite something um so don't underestimate serendipity although it's a shame that
06:48:47.040 that is always going to be a part of the answer. Thanks Ross Ram if we can come to you as an innovator as somebody who
06:48:53.840 you know works within the life science ecosystem. What I suppose where's your northstar
06:49:00.320 here? Do you are you somebody who you know sits there waiting for you know the policies to to drop as it were? Are you
06:49:07.280 more interested in the customer in front of you and what their kind of local needs are? Is there a mixture of the two? How do you navigate this?
06:49:12.478 Yeah know it's a it's a it's a good question. Right. So there's there's um I reflect on I guess the the landscape in
06:49:20.478 terms of two types of solutions that I'm seeing that you have the horizontal kind of technology-led solution that's almost
06:49:26.478 use case agnostic then you have the really point solutions technology enabled but very focused on like a
06:49:32.320 clinical pathway effectively and and where where where we are focused on
06:49:38.240 effectively is we have a bit of both as context. So we have the horizontal solution that can be applicable to use cases there multiple use cases and we
06:49:44.798 can also focus very much on that the policy landscape kind of lends at the moment effectively to um where some of
06:49:52.160 those various acronyms that are coming out on back large kind of data platforms
06:49:57.520 and so on so forth are very much broad horizontal use case agnostic to a certain degree but I think where where I
06:50:04.878 feel the most impact will be had in the immediate term with longer term scalability effectively is in those
06:50:11.040 point solutions very much driven by that. We heard a lot about essentially in the morning uh morning sessions and
06:50:17.360 panels about kind of redesigning the pathways effectively like ripping the ripping it to shreds and redesigning it
06:50:23.440 from the bottom up. Um and I think for for that to happen we we do need to um
06:50:29.600 we need to really be crystal focused on those problem state which I mentioned before and I guess the experience I can
06:50:35.440 draw on my experience in a a kind of like an opposite reaction to I think what Nathan you said. So before I joined
06:50:42.638 Quantex, I had my own startup and I actually felt like I had a had a deeper understanding of the funding streams,
06:50:49.360 the problem statements effectively they are trying to solve effectively and the root to scalability but I struggle to
06:50:55.600 enact that whereas sitting on the other side effectively where um we we have a
06:51:02.878 larger organization effectively more doors more doors are being opened effectively but we're almost being
06:51:08.478 forced into that side of big policy landscape. cape effectively and um and
06:51:13.760 almost forcing ourselves into that focused area effectively to be able to have the maximum impact if that makes
06:51:19.200 sense. So it's a bit of a like so where are we focused on to answer your question effectively we we we're trying
06:51:24.958 to be that foundational at least context are trying to be that foundational data layer that effectively drives change at
06:51:32.320 the end of the day. And so we're certainly kind of keeping an eye on the landscape on the policy landscape in order for us to kind of um en ensure
06:51:39.040 that we maximize our our impact to the NHS. But the reality is we are very much
06:51:46.160 ingrained in local innovation. So we're we're we we're ingrained in Liverpool at the moment effectively looking at
06:51:51.520 vulnerable children as I think one our founder mentioned and we're we're scaling from local to national with a
06:51:57.600 view effectively aligning to the policy landscape. Thanks so much R. Um maybe time for one
06:52:03.440 two questions but that's all because short of time so we'll just take one from the center here.
06:52:10.160 Any quick second hands? Okay, one second hand over here as well. Thank you. Those two questions then we'll wrap up.
06:52:16.320 Hi panel. Thank you very much for your um responses and your chat today. My name is Lucy Williams. I work at Durham
06:52:22.320 University and I work as a partnership manager with my local NHS trust of county D and Darlington.
06:52:29.520 I was wondering what the panel think about the fact that we have so many different foundation trusts acute and
06:52:36.718 also those with who support mental health and the like. How they all do
06:52:41.840 innovation and research differently. What can we do to generalize this? Because the structure that Andrew has in
06:52:49.040 North Umbrea is very different to the structure of the trust that I specialize and work in as we do with other partner
06:52:55.360 NHS trusts that we work in at Durham. And this is just around health and life sciences. What can we do to try and
06:53:01.440 generalize this? What can we do to support the trusts to help them have a common approach? Because every trust
06:53:08.160 that you go to has got a different management setup. They've got different routes of funding. They've got different sizes of teams. And it would be really
06:53:15.360 great if we could um for us innovators through the universities if we can find a common approach we can take with our
06:53:21.920 NHS partners because there's stuff that we've seen in the DAI report. I just went through and went right that's
06:53:27.440 computer science that's psychology that's sports science and every single
06:53:32.638 challenge that I had I knew we could deliver a solution in collaboration but
06:53:39.120 it's making sure that they've got the head space that everybody talks about that they've got the capacity of staff
06:53:45.200 and that they're not hindered by cash flow flow by headcount limitations to
06:53:50.638 bring in collaboration. So be really interested to see what your thoughts are. Thank you. standardization of
06:53:55.920 innovation, capacity and capability. Let's take Ros and Andrew on that one.
06:54:01.600 So I I completely recognize the problem that you're setting out. Um I think like two two reflections from me. So um you
06:54:08.558 will have heard from the government uh sort of very strong enthusiasm for not telling the local system how to do it.
06:54:15.040 Um and so I think like being a very practical person um I would say that it
06:54:20.080 is unlikely that we'll be in a world where we'll suddenly see government in a top- down fashion saying uh this is how
06:54:25.840 you should structure things. This is how you should build in the capacity. This is what the headcount look should look like. However, what I do see um and to
06:54:32.958 sort of take it to a sort of slightly more hopeful space um uh for you um uh is a real um thoughtfulness u from the
06:54:39.760 political teams um uh in DHSC um and indeed from the senior leadership in thinking about how do you make sure that
06:54:46.478 you are ensuring that um research innovation life sciences has the right level of priority um across the totality
06:54:53.600 of the NHS that there are not some trusts some ICBS that are sort of really prioritizing and others that are not. um
06:54:59.760 Minister Ahmed who has um uh recently been appointed um uh has sort of really
06:55:04.958 sort of strong passions on this um subject. So I suspect where we should and I hope will go is a world of saying
06:55:12.000 this is what we think good will look like now you go and do it. Um uh which is not exactly the answer you want but I
06:55:18.878 think will mean that the outcomes should end up in a better more more more what you want.
06:55:24.240 Thanks Andy. Yes. Um, it's a great question and there will be that variation between organizations. There's
06:55:30.638 at least two or three colleagues in the room from different organizations across Northeast and North Cumbria who have a
06:55:36.240 different setup. Um, it is partly a fact of life. I think it's also partly where health innovation networks are the
06:55:42.080 answer because they can help to um ensure against exactly that variation
06:55:47.840 and support us and help us fill in the gaps and we get something from it and I I do believe that external partners get something from that as well.
06:55:53.840 Thank you. Thank you for that question. Right, last question of the day. Thank you. Uh my name is Daniel Walsh
06:56:01.360 and from my accent you'll know that uh I'm not from these parts
06:56:07.680 but I've traveled from London today and I must start by saying Richard you
06:56:14.400 and the team have done an incredible job.
06:56:20.638 So incredible in fact we've spoken very briefly
06:56:25.840 uh I have decided to start investigating relocating my company
06:56:32.240 to God's own country which is what I affectionately refer to Yorkshire
06:56:38.400 and we're going to do that and do that very very quickly. I did want to ask will we get copies of the presentation
06:56:45.600 slides after the event Richard? Excellent question, Daniel. Helen's nodding at me. Yes, we will. Nerv,
06:56:51.280 that's a metric. Write it down. Thank you, Daniel.
06:56:56.718 Congratulations to you and the team. You've done a brilliant job and I'm
06:57:01.840 afraid you might just be stuck with me. Brilliant, Daniel. Thank you so much.
06:57:06.878 Um, that's just a lovely way to end. Um, thank you so much for that. Um, we are out of time. I'm conscious that Nick and
06:57:13.680 Dean are about to wrap us up, but um, it would be ridiculous to miss this opportunity. Um, just to embarrass Ros
06:57:21.520 one more time. Um, Ros alluded to the fact that, um, she won't be in this role for much longer. Um, she's moving on to
06:57:27.680 pastures new and she'll do incredibly well there, too. Um, you may not have heard of Ros before today. many many of
06:57:33.920 you will have done, but um a an a quietly um impactful leader who was
06:57:39.760 worked behind the scenes relentlessly um for a number of years on our agenda and numerous agendas driving life sciences
06:57:46.320 across the UK um and done so in in a very humble way. um she's a huge and
06:57:53.360 hugely supportive um supporter of us as health innovation networks and academic
06:57:58.638 health networks beforehand and that support simply cannot be underestimated. So, um, we are incredibly grateful and
06:58:06.160 we're incredibly humbled, um, by everything that Ros has done for us and how she's championed us as an entity,
06:58:13.840 you know, our sustainability, our future across government with many, many ministers, um, past and present. Um,
06:58:21.120 obviously, best of luck in your new role, but you'll be hugely missed. And on behalf of all of us at every single
06:58:26.878 health innovation network, thank you for everything you've done, Ross.
06:58:36.878 That's incredibly kind. Although I should say that I think it's also the first time I've ever been described as quietly impactful. So I'll take 50% of
06:58:44.958 it anyway. Um uh so you're right. I have been a sort of constant champion of the health innovation network and like that
06:58:51.680 is only for one reason. I can see that it makes a real difference and to be honest I'm a bit weary of people I say
06:58:57.760 this as I'm about to leave government. wary of people wanting to meddle with things that work really well rather than just letting them succeed. So the thing
06:59:04.718 that I have been really really keen on doing and have um hopefully sort of you know helped to solidify is you don't
06:59:11.440 need the health innovation networks do not need to be meddled with. They need to be allowed to get on with their job and to work out how like they can uh
06:59:18.558 maximize your potential because you are awesome. The second thing to say um is um that I'm off to be the CEO of the
06:59:25.040 academy of medical sciences. So life sciences will remain sort of like at the heart of what everything that I would
06:59:30.958 do. My absolute intention is to take that job um and uh turn us into as an
06:59:37.200 organization an engine of growth and as you will have gathered from my first comment you know that I know where
06:59:42.400 growth comes from. So um uh you will inevitably be seeing me um again in a different um uh a different guise um and
06:59:49.520 I will work on the quietly impactful. Thank you Ross. Thank you. And can I thank the rest of the panel as well.
07:00:06.000 And so the day comes to a close. Um I uh
07:00:11.120 my name is Dean Fathers and um uh following a theme that we've had today
07:00:17.200 uh I am a very proud Yorkshire but I have to confess that I'm also
07:00:23.760 proud to have been adopted by the Northeast as the chair of the health innovation network for the northeast of
07:00:30.080 North Cumbria. And I've got a very simple task to do before I hand over to
07:00:35.440 Nick who is my chief. Uh and um and that is to say thank you to lots and lots of
07:00:42.798 different people. So first of all thank you to all of you for having the
07:00:49.200 resilience to stay till the end. Uh I saw the wave disappear just before I got
07:00:55.440 up. So, I know that you are the stalwarts uh that are going to join us for a drink afterwards, I'm sure, uh and
07:01:02.718 celebrate the event today. So, thank you very much. I know some of you have had real difficulty getting here today,
07:01:09.440 apparently from Manchester. It's been a a major crisis uh on the rail network and of course we did have uh uh
07:01:16.958 Yorkshire rain this morning. Um, I really would like to make the first
07:01:23.680 thanks to Batman and Robin, uh, the, uh, the desperate duo. And, um, uh, the two
07:01:31.600 of you are absolutely have been inspirational over the last two years. Uh, it's been a pleasure to work with
07:01:38.400 you. It's been a delight. I'm glad to say you're not disappearing. Uh, I I
07:01:43.520 don't know if anybody felt that that might have been the message, but you're very much still going to be around the
07:01:49.600 network and uh we can look forward to continuing to work with you in the future as well. So, so thank you very
07:01:56.080 much for for that. Um we also um we've got some sponsors who are up there, but
07:02:02.400 we had two sponsors who came along last night that we also need to thank. So,
07:02:07.440 Gemma and Rob from Hill Dickinson. Um the good news uh Richard is I did hear
07:02:13.680 uh Rob say that he would uh buy Sheffield Wednesday a new football ground. So that commitment from Bill
07:02:19.760 Dickinson is now recorded live across the entire globe. Uh so good luck there.
07:02:27.760 um the um uh and also CLA from Paxman who who can't be here today uh but
07:02:34.160 Paxman were uh very good at doing a real patient story driver for why we do
07:02:41.040 innovation in the NHS and that was such a a powerful message we got last night. So thank you Claire as well if you're
07:02:47.760 listening uh it is appreciated. We've got some fantastic sponsors uh Anna and
07:02:53.200 the team from Beringa Engelheim. We're delighted in the northeast to be working very closely with them. Uh and uh we're
07:03:00.558 very supportive of of all of those collaborations. Collaboration has been the theme of the day and turning
07:03:08.160 conversation into collaboration. I'm going to come back to in a few seconds. Uh but Bo Ringer is a great
07:03:14.080 collaborator, a great partner and uh we're proud to be partners with them. Um we also heard from Craig uh from First
07:03:21.840 Data Bank. It was great that he was here today and supporting and it was good that we've got that team here. So, thank
07:03:27.920 you for your sponsorship. Um, Nexus, the last time I was in the room with uh with
07:03:34.160 um Nexus, um I've got to say, Nathan, you were picking up a national award. I was on
07:03:40.400 the judging panel for um Medylinks and Nexus had um won a national award. So,
07:03:46.638 we are sponsored by an awardwinning organization in the form of Nexus. So thank you Nathan please take our thanks
07:03:53.440 back to your team as well. And then finally uh Imman and u Raj from context
07:04:00.000 um you know you've spoken on the panel and and given us some great insights as well as all of the other speakers today.
07:04:06.558 So as speakers I'd like to thank all of you that have contributed. We've had a national uh kind of presence here today
07:04:13.680 in in uh two forms uh and but we've importantly had some real live
07:04:19.760 innovators and I've got to say the pictures were brilliant. I thoroughly enjoyed those. I've been associated with
07:04:26.958 the clinical entrepreneur program now for nine of the 10 years uh officially
07:04:32.558 unofficially I sponsored and championed when I was chair of an acute trust one of the very first ones without even
07:04:39.200 knowing I was mentoring him uh because the pitch that Tony gives was so strong
07:04:45.440 from this person that I couldn't absolutely not be his mentor so it's a
07:04:50.558 great program fully endorse it and anybody who wants to join it. Uh, I
07:04:55.920 strongly suggest you do so. So, thank you to all of those. The biggest thank
07:05:01.840 you I've got to say has got to go to We wouldn't be here without these people.
07:05:09.120 um uh Helen Williams and um uh Kathy
07:05:15.200 Scott and the four whole teams of the health events uh kind of uh people that
07:05:24.000 have just put hours and days, sweat, pain, toil into organizing this. Thank
07:05:31.840 you all of you. This is something which we do so well.
07:05:39.520 And you really all do deserve that round of applause. Absolutely superb. But
07:05:45.440 before I hand over to I just want to share with you when when I was a young man uh before uh Richard was even
07:05:52.240 thought of as a young man. Um, I was in in Leeds at the Queens Hotel and I had
07:05:57.600 the pleasure of um meeting a guy called John Cle that old people like me will
07:06:02.718 know about uh of Montipython fame and and um John shared
07:06:09.600 um a secret to creativity which I've used continuously in the way
07:06:16.160 that I try to develop collaborative, creative, value adding partnerships
07:06:22.080 forever. And I'm going to segue this into Nick who's going to take it up and and run with it. And and the the kind of
07:06:30.160 five ingredients for success in creativity and innovation
07:06:35.440 are first getting the right people around you. We've got a fantastic audience today. Hopefully you've had the
07:06:42.878 chance to network. Hopefully, you've had the chance to find out what each of you are wanting to do, and you've gone away
07:06:50.240 with something positive and passionate to do in the workplace after today to to
07:06:57.840 take the momentum forward. So, first of all, you need people. The second thing
07:07:02.958 you need to do is have fun with them. Hopefully, you've enjoyed the day. Hopefully, you've had fun. Certainly,
07:07:08.320 there's been laughter until I got up here anyway. And a consequence of that,
07:07:13.680 you're going to take those memories back with yourself. What you then need is
07:07:19.600 time. This has been designed deliberately to give you the time to think, to take that
07:07:28.160 and develop it. And you need a space to do it in. And one of the things that attracted me to working with Nick in the
07:07:35.360 northeast is you painted this vision of us having this collaborative space up in the northeast uh where we could actually
07:07:42.638 bring innovators together to share time and ideas and fun with each other for
07:07:49.280 the purpose of dealing with the health health inequities that we've got within our system. And then when you've got
07:07:55.760 that time, that space, don't go with the first idea. Spend even more time. And
07:08:04.160 the good news is, and this is my segue to unit, we are going to have more time
07:08:09.520 at a future space somewhere else in the future, and you're going to reveal where
07:08:15.040 that is. Thank you, Dean. So again, I just want to echo what Dean has said. Thank you to all of those that have been involved in
07:08:20.558 the organization of this. I know it hasn't it's been a total mean feast. Also to Batman and Robin again I would
07:08:26.320 like to express my thanks. Hopefully it will be a new duo. We've let the anton deck of the health innovation.
07:08:33.440 We're not taking over from Batman and Robin but um but no today has been uh really enlightening. There's been some
07:08:38.878 fantastic conversations around innovation. Thank you very much to all of you who've taken part. Of course,
07:08:44.400 we've got a long long history across the north of innovation and whoever organized the conference in the week
