People Priorities 

Strategy

**FOREWORD**

The Trust’s current People Priorities were introduced prior to the publication of the Interim NHS People Plan in 2019, and 

the NHS People Plan 2020/21 which was published at the 

end of July 2020, along with the 

Our NHS People Promise. 

Our People Priorities have remained relevant since 2018 and have guided our work, including the period throughout the Covid 19 pandemic and the immediate recovery period

Our People Priorities are fully embedded within the Trust. HR & OD and CSU 

prioritisation, work organisation, monitoring and corporate governance have all been established around the delivery of our People Priorities. They have guided the development and implementation of so much great work by individuals, teams, Clinical Service Units \(CSUs\) and the organisation as a whole. 

However, since the launch of Trust’s People Priorities, there have also been revisions to the Trust’s: strategic triangle, multiyear goals and the introduction of the in-year Trust Commitments. There have also been significant contextual changes to the environment in which we work. 

Therefore it was appropriate to review our People Priorities to ensure they are still current and fit for purpose. 

Following this review, we have agreed six new priorities. However, our new People Priorities are very much an evolution of the original People Priorities and much remains the same, building on the excellent work undertaken during the last six years. 

In their new form, I am fully confident that our People Priorities will continue to be relevant and will continue to be an important guide for our work over the next four years.

The Leeds Improvement Method

The Leeds Improvement Method \(LIM\) is our philosophy of continuous improvement that underpins all our organisational strategies. It brings the principles of daily management methods, improvement methodology, respectful behaviours and the removal of waste from processes together. 

Our strategy framework 

This strategy is part of a wider suite of strategies that work together to support the Trust to meet its overarching vision. At the centre of this is the Trust’s corporate strategy, supported by three core strategies and ten enabling strategies. This strategy framework enables us to ensure our strategies align and are updated appropriately to reflect and support the overall Trust strategy.

People Priorities Strategy

**STRATEGIC AIMS**

Our multi-year goal is:

To have a consistent, high performing and sustainable workforce In support of this goal, our priorities are:

• To be in the top 25% performing Trusts for staff retention. 

\(2024/25 commitment\) 

• We are inclusive and champion diversity. 

• We plan and deploy our people to deliver effective care. 

• We are compassionate and effective in our leadership practices, empowering all our staff to lead by example. 

• We support each other to be well at work. 

• As a teaching hospital, we foster a culture of learning and continuous improvement, so our people realise their potential. 

The People Priorities were first introduced in the Trust in 2019 and have been reviewed in 2024. The People Priorities are designed to complement the 

seven themes of the NHS People Promise:

• We are compassionate and inclusive. 

• We are recognised and rewarded. 

• We have a voice that counts. 

• We are safe and healthy. 

• We are always learning. 

• We work flexibly. 

• We are a team. 

The Trust is fully committed to the NHS People Promise, however, we feel it is important to have bespoke priorities, fully aligned to our multi-year goal and our specific local circumstances.

**DELIVERING OUR PRIORITIES**

Joint working and accountability Internally, our HR Business Partners and HR and OD Centres of Excellence work with Clinical Service Units \(CSUs\), Corporate functions, line managers and staff representatives to continually assess progress in order to develop actions to deliver the People Priorities. 

Partnership working

Externally, we will work with partner organisation either: in the City of Leeds; across the West Yorkshire Association of Acute Trusts \(WYAAT\); the wider Integrated Care Board \(ICB\); or regionally with NHS England \(NHSE\) to develop consistent and shared people management practices and systems, at the appropriate level. 

We also work in close partnership with colleagues form the recognised trade unions and professional bodies. 

Leading the Leeds Way

The contribution that our leaders play is crucial to achieving the People Priorities by leading the Leeds Way, utilising the management fundamentals toolkit.

Research

We will ensure all our approaches are based on the best available research and as required we work in partnership with academic institutions to undertake research. 

Embracing technology

New technologies have and will continue to have a significant impact on the work of our staff and with the advent of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, this trend is likely to accelerate. Technology has the potential to increase productivity, flexibility and accessibility. 

We will work to:

• Equip our people with the skills and knowledge to harness the benefits of technology. 

• Ensure our people management practices and systems utilise technology for increased efficiency and accessibility. 

• Use technology to allow all job roles to make the maximum contribution to high quality care. 

Leeds Improvement Method

We will continue to embed the Leeds Improvement Method \(LIM\) into our people management practices and systems in order to remove waste and increase efficiency.

People Priorities Strategy

Robust governance

The Executive-led, multi professional Workforce Management Group has authority to review, discuss and make decisions regarding issues related to the workforce and the People Priorities relevant to the Clinical Services Units within the Trust. 

There are a number of subgroups to the Workforce Management Group:

• Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Group

• Health and Wellbeing Group

• Learning Education and Training Committee

• Resource Management Group

• Staff Engagement Group

These groups have delegated authority to progress specific People Priorities. 

Assurance to the Trust Board will be provided through the Workforce Committee. 

Objective outcome measures for each of our People Priorities have been set to ensure there is a clear understanding of what success looks like. These are detailed in the table below:

Management of risk

The management of workforce risks and the health and safety of our people are essential to the delivery of our People Priorities. The People Priorities provide a framework for the management of these risks. 

Senior HR Business Partners play a key role to work with our Clinical Service Units \(CSUs\) to identify and manage risks. 

At a corporate level, the standard work of the committee structure described above, includes the consideration of risks, identifying any gaps in controls and escalating as appropriate.
