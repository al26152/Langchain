**Operational transformation**

Our Operational Strategy is an ambitious plan to achieve our vision to provide the highest quality integrated and specialist care, delivered in a supportive environment that develops our people and produces optimal outcomes for our patients. 

Despite continuing operational challenges, we have seen significant improvement across many of our services in relation to outpatient waiting times and access to elective and non-elective care. Our dedicated teams have delivered patient-centred transformational work that is now improving the experiences of our patients and outcomes across a number of areas including:

**• **Planned care

The chart below shows elective admissions for under 18s from 2017 to 2024 broken down by IMD 

\(1 being most deprived and 10 being least deprived\). We can see that total elective activity has recovered to a higher rate in 2024 then it was prior to the pandemic. We can also see that between 2023 and 2024 elective activity increased at a faster rate in IMD 1 than those in IMD 2-10. This is a welcome trend, as elective activity is better for patients and will help to address the disproportionate need for emergency admissions observed within patients from IMD 1 due to unmet health needs. 

This is in line with the Leeds city ambition to improve the health of the poorest, fastest.

**Elective activity vs pre-pandemic levels for over-18s**

The chart below shows elective admissions for over 18s from 2017 to 2024 broken down by IMD \(1 

being most deprived and 10 being least deprived\). We can see that total elective activity has recovered to a higher rate in 2024 than it was prior to the pandemic. In 2024, adults in IMD 1 made up 39% 

of elective activity, despite only accounting for approximately 26% of the adult population of Leeds. 

This trend is expected due to the higher burden of ill health in more deprived neighbourhoods. It is important to address the unmet needs of those living in more deprived neighbourhoods with planned care to reduce unpleasant and costly emergency admissions.

Overview



Emergency Admissions to LTHT for Under 18s 

If we examine our emergency admissions resulting from attendance at the Emergency Department for children and young people by the IMD, we can see that 38% of our admissions are from 0–17-year olds who live in our most deprived communities \(IMD 1\). This is 4% \(approximately 2,000 

admissions\) higher than expected if these rates were to re ect the population make up of Leeds where 34% of Leeds children reside in IMD 1 neighborhoods. 

Overall, only 56% of admissions were recorded as being White British, compared to 64% of the overall population of children in Leeds. If we further examine this breakdown by ethnicity, we can see that ethnic minority groups make up the majority \(56%\) of admissions within IMD 1. Broadly, as we move up the Index of Multiple Deprivation, the proportion of emergency admissions from ethnic minority communities decrease \(47% in IMD 2 to 24% in IMD 10\). This broadly re ects the population, where we know ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented in more deprived communities.

April 2024

We put the spotlight on our wonderful 

administrative colleagues in our second 

Celebrating Admin awards ceremony, 

held at the Thackray Medical Museum. 

Winners and highly commended staff were 

nominated in six categories, recognising 

the vital role played by the Trust’s 

administrative staff in ensuring the smooth 

running of our services. 

May 2024

Congratulations to Misbah Mahmood, Deputy 

Chief Midwifery Information Officer, who 

was awarded the prestigious Chief Midwifery 

Officer Silver award from the National 

Chief Midwifery Information Officer, Jules 

Gudgeon. The award recognises midwives 

whose performance goes above and beyond 

their everyday role, and celebrated Misbah’s 

leadership and passion. 

June 2024

The first diggers broke ground at Seacroft 

Hospital, location for the planned Rob 

Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease. 

The milestone event was attended by 

many of the project’s supporters, including 

clinical staff, Leeds Hospitals Charity

July 2024

The simple step of saying ‘ *Hello, My Name *

*Is…*’ to a patient or visitor is instantly warm 

and reassuring, and it’s the reason why 10 

years ago Dr Kate Granger launched her 

campaign of the same name. This month, the 

campaign was relaunched where it all started 

– across our hospitals in Leeds - encouraging 

staff to pledge to introduce themselves and 

get a Hello, My Name Is badge. 

The Trust’s annual Time To Shine awards was 

the largest celebration event yet, thanks 

to funding from Leeds Hospitals Charity 

and Sovereign Health Care. It was the 

first year that the awards categories were 

themed around each of the 7 Commitments, 

with 500 nominations from across the 

organisation showcasing the breadth of 

dedication and hard work. 

August 2024

We celebrated one of the oldest kidney 

transplants in the country this month. In 1974, 

13-year-old Mike Shepherdson went into 

surgery at St James’s Hospital for what was 

in those days a rare operation and certainly 

one that never happened on children. Thanks 

to the organ donor, their family, and the team 

that gave Mike his new kidney on that day, he 

has gone on to live an extra 50 years of life, 

something that he remains ever grateful for. 

A new show garden created by the Stroke 

Association, which won bronze at this year’s 

RHS Chelsea Flower Show, was moved to 

its permanent home at Chapel Allerton 

Hospital. The ‘Garden for Recovery’ was 

officially opened by Emmerdale actor 

Mark Charnock and provides a place for 

connection and rest for stroke survivors and 

their families, supporting them in achieving 

their best possible recovery.

September 2024

Congratulations to the Leeds Twins & Multiples 

Midwifery team, which made the national finals of 

the NHS Parliamentary Awards after winning the 

regional NHS Nursing & Midwifery Award. Laura 

Jones and Nicky Nicholson are specialist midwives 

providing dedicated care to patients pregnant 

with a multiple pregnancy. They pride themselves 

on giving patients continuity, expert care and 

support during high-risk pregnancies. 

A £2.7 million study to improve gallstone 

treatment launched at Leeds. The trial, led by 

LTHT and the Clinical Trials Research Unit at the 

University of Leeds, seeks to resolve the clinical 

uncertainty surrounding whether patients 

benefit from gallbladder removal following 

successful removal of gallstones from the bile 

duct. The study is funded by the National 

Institute for Health and Care Research and will 

be conducted over three years. 

October 2024

The NHS Community Diagnostic Centre 

\(CDC\) - Beeston was opened in Leeds, 

bringing a range of health services closer 

to people in the community. The LTHT-run 

centre offers ultrasound, a range of cardio-

respiratory services including ambulatory 

blood pressure tests, ECG, and sleep 

studies, and blood tests \(phlebotomy\) - 

bringing important services closer to home. 

A new £12 million Elective Care Hub was 

opened at Wharfedale Hospital, which 

includes operating theatres and wards, 

reducing the time patients wait for surgery 

and providing protected space for planned 

operations to take place. The new hub 

allows for additional operating theatre 

capacity away from the Trust’s main acute 

hospital sites, increasing the number of 

patients that can be treated each week.

November 2024

Ten years of fun and laughter were 

celebrated at Leeds Children’s Hospital with 

a ‘Giggle Doctor takeover’. These professional 

performers from Theodora Children’s Charity 

undergo specialist training for over two 

years to equip them to work in hospitals 

and understand the needs of young patients 

alongside the hospital Play team. Play 

therapy is a vital intervention to help reduce 

children’s stress and anxiety when in hospital. 

December 2024

We were proud to mark 20 years of our Newborn 

Hearing Screening, a service that has tested the 

hearing of more than 180,000 babies since it was 

established in 2004. Over two decades, the team 

of 14 screeners has provided families in Leeds with 

early detection of hearing loss, enabling them to 

access the intervention and support they need. Early 

detection enables babies and their families to access 

appropriate support from the paediatric audiology 

team, ensuring the best possible start in life. 

January 2025

The UK’s first liver transplant for advanced bowel 

cancer was made possible in Leeds thanks to the 

collaboration between the liver transplant team at 

LTHT and the cancer centre at The Christie NHS 

Foundation Trust in Manchester. Bianca Perea from 

Manchester became the first person in the UK to 

undergo the procedure, which successfully removed 

the tumours and led her to being cancer free. 

Also this month – another UK first. Ruvimbo 

Kaviya became the first person in the UK 

to have a brain tumour surgically removed 

through her eye socket. The minimally invasive 

surgical technique avoids large incisions and 

lengthy recovery time typically associated 

with operating on this area of the brain. The 

approach has the potential to transform the 

lives of people with skull base tumours.

Overview





February 2025

Patients were able to start accessing a 

wide range of health services at a new 

NHS Community Diagnostic Centre, which 

opened at Armley Moor Health Centre. 

The CDC, operated by LTHT, offers tests 

including ultrasounds, ECGs, blood tests, 

blood pressure checks, sleep studies and 

spirometry testing. It meant local people 

no longer had to travel into the city’s larger 

hospitals for these tests. 

March 2025

A milestone was reached this month for our 

stop smoking service, funded by Yorkshire 

Cancer Research. More than 1,000 patients 

have now successfully quit smoking thanks to 

bedside interventions for patients in hospital. 

The service launched in November 2022 and 

offers people access to nicotine replacement 

products and tailored support. They may also 

be referred to community services for follow-up 

support once discharged. 

Clinical staff from the Children’s Emergency 

Department LGI joined forces with specialist 

officers from West Yorkshire Police to deliver 

a series of knife crime prevention workshops 

in seven secondary schools across Leeds this 

month. The pilot project looked to reach 

pupils in years eight and nine as part of 

ongoing partnership efforts to deter young 

people from carrying knives by showing the 

severe consequences of knife crime.

**Capital investment **

In 2024/25, capital investment continued to be underpinned by our previous year’s surpluses. Capital expenditure was £76.5m. The Trust has been able to invest in its operations such as the Rob Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease at Seacroft Hospital, the Electronic Health Record, and the Elective Care Hub at Wharfedale Hospital. The table and graph below show how the Trust has been able to build and sustain our level of capital expenditure over the last seven years.

Note 1: A redundancy payment in the banding £100-£150k was made in respect of the departure of J Goodyear. 

This payment was made under standard NHS terms and conditions. 

• Taxable expense payments are rounded to the nearest £100 in the above table. Pension related benefits are shown in bands of £2,500. All other remuneration is shown in bands of £5,000. 

• Salary includes all amounts paid and payable in respect of the period the individual held office. 

• Taxable expenses for the Chief Digital and Information Office, the Director of Estates and Facilities, the Director of Planning and Strategy and the Interim and incoming Directors of Finance include the value of lease cars paid via salary sacrifice. All other taxable expenses are in respect of taxable business mileage, car parking and telephone costs. 

96

Accountability

• Other payments represent a national clinical excellence award made to the Chief Executive, and payments on departure in respect of leave not taken for the Director of Planning and Strategy and outgoing Director of Finance. 

• There are no long-term performance pay or bonuses for senior managers in the current or preceding financial years. 

• All pension-related benefits are calculated using the HMRC method as set out in Section 229 of the Finance Act 2004. The Department of Health and Social Care has clarified that for NHS bodies this is the “real increase in pension multiplied by 20 plus the real increase in lump sum less contributions made by the individual equals Accrued Pension Benefits.” The NHS Pension Scheme is a “defined benefits” scheme based on final salary and/or career average earnings. Thus, where a senior manager’s salary increases this results in a larger movement in the overall value of their pension entitlement. Similarly, where there is a limited increase in the value of the pension payable relative to in ation and the employee’s contributions, then the HMRC calculation can show a “negative pensions benefits” figure for the year which is then shown as a “nil” figure in the table. 

These factors mean that year on year there can be significant volatility in the reported pensions benefits for an individual.

**Staff Survey**

Highly engaged staff, that is, those who are 

committed to their organisation and involved 

in their roles, are more likely to bring their heart 

and soul to work, to take the initiative, to ‘go 

the extra mile’ and to collaborate effectively 

with others. 

There is now an overwhelming body of 

evidence to show that engagement not 

only creates a positive working environment 

for individuals, but also directly contributes 

towards the quality of care delivered and 

better patient outcomes. 

‘The NHS providers with high levels of staff 

engagement \(as measured in the annual NHS 

Staff Survey\) tend to have lower levels of

Key achievements in 2024/25

**Patient information lea ets**

• Following a pilot in Maternity and Emergency 

departments, the Trust rolled out Sign-Live 

\(a service offering BSL interpreting via video\) 

Trustwide. The app is on more than 1,325 

clinical iPads across all seven LTHT hospitals. 

• Awareness sessions have been delivered to 

services by the Interpreting Lead, together 

with communication through regular 

channels. The sessions included awareness 

that SignLive is available to clinicians for use 

when a face-to-face interpreter is not present. 

Background 

The Trust aims to ensure that all patient 

information lea ets \(PILs\) made available to 

patients, carers and the public are in date, 

clearly written and accessible. PILs are available 

on the Trust website, under Adults, Children’s 

and Easy Read categories. They can also be 

searched via the A-Z Search facility. 

In January 2025 there were 1,464 patient 

information resources available on the Trust 

website. This included 128 PILs in Easy Read 

format, 27 videos and 40 links to external 

sources.

**Volunteering**

The number of volunteers that have gifted 

their time and skills has increased to 195 

volunteers. This has resulted in an increase in 

the hours gifted to 9,592. 

Volunteers are active in a variety of roles that 

support our patients, staff or the organisation. 

55 of our volunteers were on the ‘Volunteer to 

Career’ pathway and an additional 11 e-learning 

modules were created or refreshed to best 

prepare them for volunteering, as well as some 

role-specific supplementary training to empower 

them to support our patients with visual 

impairments, learning disabilities and autism. 

Understanding the experience of our volunteers 

is important. 38% of our volunteers completed 

our annual volunteer survey. 100% of volunteers 

would recommend LTHT as a place to volunteer 

and 98% strongly agreed that volunteers have

**Information on reserves**

Public dividend capital

Public dividend capital \(PDC\) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS organisation. Additional PDC may also be issued to trusts by the Department of Health and Social Care. A charge, re ecting the cost of capital utilised by the trust, is payable to the Department of Health as the public dividend capital dividend. 

Revaluation reserve

Increases in asset values arising from revaluations are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse impairments previously recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating income. Subsequent downward movements in asset valuations are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain was recognised unless the downward movement represents a clear consumption of economic benefit or a reduction in service potential. 

Income and expenditure reserve

The balance of this reserve is the accumulated surpluses and deficits of the Trust.
