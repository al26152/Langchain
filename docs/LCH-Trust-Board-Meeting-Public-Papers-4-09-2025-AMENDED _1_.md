The Trust Chair opened the Board meeting and welcomed members and attendees. He particularly welcomed Dr Sara Munro to her first meeting as Interim Chief Executive of the Trust and Jodie Collins who was attending to speak about the work of the Trust’s Charity.

He said that this was a time of major change, and the Trust had already faced the challenge by:

-

Rationalising its business to manage costs down whilst maintaining high standards of performance and delivery. 

-

Shaped and developed partnerships – particularly with fellow trusts and with the local authorities in order to improve the Trust’s offer. 

-

Sustained an organisation with positive values and where patient care was the primary focus. 

Next steps would be about influencing the future.

**Discussion points:**

**Chief Executive’s report **

The Interim Chief Executive presented the report which focussed on: 

• National and Regional NHS

• Quality and Value Programme

Page 3 of 12

• Business Unit Updates

• Education Update

The Interim Chief Executive referred to the recent announcement that Richard Barker CBE would oversee the abolition of NHS England and the merger of its functions into the Department of Health and Social Care and the publication of a timescale for completion of the process. 

Regionally the West Yorkshire Integrated Care Board \(ICB\) had submitted a proposed new structure to NHS England on 30 May 2025. A Transition Board had been established to oversee the process which would include regional and local representation. The appointment of the new ICB Chair had been paused. 

The Executive Director of Finance and Resources reported that notwithstanding the improvements to financial plans that many organisations had been able to make, across the West Yorkshire system there remained a planning gap of £33million. This would require a collective system effort to deliver. Over recent weeks, Chief Financial Officers/Directors of Finance across the 11 statutory NHS organisations in West Yorkshire had been working together to agree a process for how the system improvement value could be fairly and appropriately distributed across organisations and place, which had resulted in an improvement target of £5.2million \(0.3%\) being allocated to Leeds place. Discussions regarding how this would be delivered across the four statutory organisations remained ongoing. 

Non-Executive Director \(IL\) referred to the independent review by Attain on the community service offer across West Yorkshire, and queried when the report would be available and whether the outcomes would overlap with the Leeds Place Review. The Interim Chief Executive stated that a first draft of the report was expected by mid-June. 

The Trust Chair suggested that a summary of the headlines from the report should be circulated to Board members. 

**Action: A summary of the headlines from the Attain review on the West Yorkshire** **Community Services offer to be circulated to Board members. **

**Responsible Officer: Interim Chief Executive. **

**Outcome:** the Board

• received and noted the report. 

**Item 2025-26 \(31\)**

**Discussion points:**

**Trust Priorities 2024-25 End Of Year Report**

The Executive Director of Finance and Resources presented the report which provided a year end update on progress on the Trust Priorities for 2024-25. 

The Board reviewed the report and noted the progress made in 2024-25. 

Non-Executive Director \(IL\) commented on the success of the Enhance Model in the Neighbourhood Teams with the highest levels of deprivation and encouraged directors to try and exert more influence on system partners to agree to an increase in funding to ensure further roll out. 

Associate Non-Executive Director \(LM\) suggested that the Trust should take the opportunity to communicate the significant number of excellent achievements in the report externally via social media platforms. 

**Outcome:** the Board

• noted the report. 

Page 4 of 12

**Item 2025-26 \(32\)**

**Discussion points:**

**People Headlines and Strategy Update**

The Director of People, OD, and System Development \(LS\) presented the paper which provided the Committee with information on the key headlines linked to the Trust’s People Directorate portfolio. The paper had been reviewed by the People and Culture Committee on 21 May 2025. 

The Board noted the updated focus the Directorate would consider against each of the seven pillars of the Trust’s current Workforce Strategy. 

Non-Executive Director \(AL\) referred to the Trust’s priority that 18% of the workforce should be of a Black, Asian & Minority Ethnic background by 2028 and she queried whether the impact of the Quality and Value Programme was being tracked in relation to this. The Director of People, OD 

and System Development said that the Trust was making reasonable progress in this area and confirmed that it was a focus for monitoring within the Quality and Value data. 

Non-Executive Director \(IL\) noted that turnover rates had dropped and asked whether there were any risks associated with this. The Director of People, OD and System Development said that turnover rates between 10% and 12% were within the tolerance level to retain stability whilst bringing in fresh talent and ideas. She said that rates were beginning to rise above 10%. 

**Outcome:** the Board 

• Noted the Workforce Headlines presented in the report. 

• Noted the progress achieved in pursuit of the target measures set out in the Trust’s current Workforce Strategy. 

• Noted that the People and Culture Committee would receive this report prior to its presentation to the Board.

**Item 2025-26 \(38\)**

**Discussion points:**

**Performance Report **

The Executive Director of Finance and Resources presented the report which highlighted key areas of performance; including areas that were performing well, areas where improvement work was underway, and early warning of deteriorating performance. Performance was measured across six domains, using indicators selected by the Board at the start of the financial year. 

The Board noted that the overall picture of performance in the organisation shown by the measures in the report has not changed significantly since the last report presented to the Board. The number of measures exceeding their target had remained the same although none were showing deterioration which indicated stability with the expectation to continue to exceed the targets. 

Page 7 of 12

The Board reviewed each domain and overall, it was agreed that the new reporting format was an improvement. 

Non-Executive Director \(IL\) said that he was disappointed with how the reporting on effectiveness was reflected in the performance report with a narrow focus and a range of issues which were not reported on including outcomes, improvement and research and development. The Executive Director of Finance and Resources provided assurance that work was in progress to improve reporting on effectiveness. 

Non-Executive Director \(IL\) noted the data on staff appraisal rates and referred to the outcome of a recent internal audit report which had provided limited assurance on this. He asked what actions the Trust was taking to improve the situation. The Director of People, Organisational Development \(OD\) and System Development reported that there had been a steady and gradual improvement towards the target since August 2024, which had resulted in the highest compliance rate since 2021. She acknowledged that the recent audit had identified several actions to be implemented over the next few months which related to improving the reporting of appraisal compliance on the Electronic Staff Record \(ESR\) System, which would ensure more accurate data recording. A more detailed discussion on the outcome of the audit was scheduled at the Audit Committee meeting on 8 July 2025. 

Non-Executive Director \(AL\) highlighted the compliance data with Level 1 and 2 Safety Training and referred to the concerns which had been raised with her by staff during a service visit around accessing wound care training, where new staff reported they were waiting 12 months before they were able to undertake the training. The Executive Director of Nursing and AHPs reported that there had been a slight month on month improvement, however compliance had not reached the target of 95%, and options for accessing external wound care training were under consideration. 

Non-Executive Director \(RB\) queried the data on duty of candour which was reported as fluctuating. 

The Executive Director of Nursing and AHPs agreed to review the data and provide further information at the next meeting. 

**Action: A review of the data on duty of candour to clarify the underlying reasons for the** **fluctuating data. **

**Responsible Officer: Executive Director of Nursing and AHPs. **

Referring to the Safe Domain the Interim Chief Executive requested clarification on the reclassification of seven historic Patient Safety Incidents in April 2025 she queried how old the cases were and the implications for families and the duty of candour resulting from their reclassification. 

The Executive Director of Nursing and AHPs reported that some were 12 months old. She agreed to provide a briefing note on the implications for families and the duty of candour for the Board following the meeting. 

**Action: A briefing note to be provided for the Board on the implications of the** **reclassification of the seven historic incidents for families and duty of candour. **

**Responsible Officer: Executive Director of Nursing and AHPs. **

Non-Executive Director \(IL\) raised concerns about the Trust’s Clinical Audit Programme. It was agreed that a further discussion would be taken forward outside this meeting. 

**Action: Discussions to be taken forward via an offline conversation. **

**Responsible Officers: Non-Executive Director \(IL\) and the Executive Medical Director. **

The Executive Director of Finance and Resources provided a brief update on the financial position. 

For April 2025, the Trust had reported a breakeven financial position, which was in line with the planned target. At this early point in the year and based on Month 1 \(MO1\) performance the Trust was forecasting the delivery of its overall breakeven plan for the year. The Quality & Value Programme had achieved £0.5 million in savings during M01, contributing positively to the financial position. This performance has been formally reported to the West Yorkshire Integrated Care Board \(WYICB\). National level financial reporting had commenced from May 2025. 

At the end of April 2025, £5.3million of the £14m savings target for 2025/26 had been identified recurrently. Work continued to bridge the gap to ensure that by the end of Quarter 1 plans were fully identified, there were no high-risk schemes and all opportunities to achieve the recurrent Cost Improvement Plan \(CIP\) target were maximised. She said that there remained a high risk that in-year non recurrent measures would be needed to achieve the plan. 

**Outcome:** the Board

• received and noted the report. 

**Item 2025-26 \(39\)**

**Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response \(EPRR\) Annual Report 2024/25**

The Executive Director of Operations presented the report which had previously been considered by the Business Committee in April 2025. 

In December 2024 the Trust had received the outcome from its second self-compliance assessment against the national EPRR core standards using the new \(NHS North East & Yorkshire\) scoring system. Along with other Trusts in the region, compliance scores had improved considerably, but the Trust continued to rate as non-compliant. The EPRR Improvement Plan required a number of Trust and ICS actions to be undertaken which were scheduled to be completed by September 2025 \(prior to the submission date at the end of October 2025\). 

Internal Audit would be undertaking a review of the ratings/evidence in the summer of 2025. Other requirements such as exercises, training and partnership working had all improved the Trust’s understanding/ learning of EPRR risks and had helped to improve the plans, policies and other supporting EPRR documentation. 

**Outcome:** the Board

• received assurance that progress on the delivery of the EPRR Improvement Plan during 2024\\25 will lead to the Trust achieving at least partial compliance in this year’s audit process. 

**Item 2025-26 \(40\)**

**Discussion points:**

**Guardian for Safe Working Hours \(GSWH\)**

The GSWH presented the report for Quarter 4 to provide assurance that doctors and dentists in training within the Trust were safely rostered and that their working hours were consistent with the Junior Doctors Contract 2016 Terms & Conditions of Service \(TCS\). 

The main issues for consideration in this report were:

• Upcoming changes to managing exception reporting system. 

**Outcome: **The Board: ** **

• Supported the GSWH with the work in relation to implementation of changes for exception reporting system/pathway. 

**Item 2025-26 \(41\)**

**People and Culture Committee Terms of Reference –Draft For Approval **

Page 9 of 12

The Chair of the Committee Non-Executive Director \(RB\) presented the Terms of Reference for this new Committee for approval. They had been discussed and recommended for approval by the People and Culture Committee at its inaugural meeting on 21 May 2025. 

**Outcome:** the Board 

• reviewed and approved the draft Terms of Reference for the People and Culture Committee. 

**Item 2025-26 \(42\)**

**Discussion points:**

**People and Culture Committee Assurance Report: May 2025**

• The Committee received an update on employee relations and Freedom to Speak Up Activity, noting individual cases arising since April 2025 or currently under management. 

• The Committee received a paper, following up on the staff survey themes discussed at the last Board workshop, it was agreed that members would provide offline feedback and comments on the paper. 

• The Chair of the Race Equality Network had talked about the network activity and the Committee had discussed how to make the most of the Network Chairs’ presence at People and Culture Committee meetings, including what the Networks and the Trust asked of each other. Committee agreed to explore how to ensure an effective communication flow between the Committee and the Networks and discussed the concept of having a “staff story” for future meetings. 

• The Committee received a number of data sets showing aspects of people performance including health & wellbeing, equality, resourcing and development and discussed what additional data it would like to see in future meetings. 

• The Committee was also given a subset of the Quality and Value \(Q&V\) data pack showing the human factors data flowing from the programme. It was noted that the Business Committee Chair had escalated an item to the Committee around evidence of a decline in wellbeing arising from some of the Q&V activity which had also been reflected in some of the staff survey comments. The Committee received assurance that action plans had been developed following the latest survey results. 

• **Risks Discussed and New Risks Identified**

The Executive Director of Nursing and AHPs advised that the risks relevant to the People and Culture Committee’s work were in the process of being extracted from Datix to provide a comprehensive view of people related risks across the Trust and that this paper would be available for oversight and discussion at future meetings

**Outcome:** the Board 

• noted the assurance report and the matters highlighted. 

**Item 2025-26 \(43\)**

**Discussion points **

**Code of Governance Compliance **

The Company Secretary presented the report which set out the Trust’s ongoing compliance against the requirements of the new Code of Governance which came into force on 1 April 2023 and reported the Trust’s compliance against the standards. 

The Company Secretary highlighted one statement marked as non-compliant, relating to the Trust having a policy on its purchase of non-audit services from its external auditor, for which an explanation had been provided. Although the Trust could evidence the process for appointing the external auditors through Auditor Panel and Board reports, work needed to be undertaken to develop this specific policy. It was noted that the external auditors had not undertaken any non-audit work during the period of their contract with the Trust. This provision had therefore been marked as non-compliant but the intent to comply confirmed and a policy would be developed during 2025/26. 

**Outcome:** the Board 

Page 10 of 12

• Noted the requirements of the Code of Governance for provider trusts, and the assurance that would be provided in due course by External Audit against the publication within the Annual Report. 

• Reflected on the self-assessment of the comply or explain against the statements of the Code and approve this as an accurate reflection of the Board and practices at the Trust. 

• Approved the inclusion of a declaration within the Annual Report as below:

*The Board recognises the importance of the Code of Governance and has undertaken a* *review of compliance. There have not been any contraventions of the Code but there is* *one area where further work is indicated to declare full compliance going forwards. \(This is* *highlighted amber within Schedule A\). *

**Welcome introduction, apologies, and preliminary business **

The Trust Vice Chair opened the Extraordinary Trust Board meeting. 

**Apologies**

Apologies were received and accepted from Brodie Clark CBE, Laura Smith and Lynsey Yeomans. 

**Item 2025-26 \(52\)**

**Discussion points:**

**Declarations of interest**

Prior to the Trust Board meeting, the Trust Chair had considered the Directors’ declarations of interest register and the agenda content to ensure there was no known conflict of interest prior to papers being distributed to Board members. 

**Item 2025-26 \(53\)**

**Discussion points:**

**Update from the Chair of the Audit Committee on end year Committee meeting on 23 June** **2025 **

Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Audit Committee \(KR\) provided a verbal update on the deliberations of the Audit Committee on 23 June 2025. 

He informed the Board that the Committee had given full and proper scrutiny to the Trust’s accounts for 2024-25. The Committee had also reviewed the draft letter of representation and the audit completion report on the Trust’s financial statements issued by the external auditors, Forvis Mazars. 

He reported that he was satisfied with the opportunity the Committee had had to review the annual report and accounts and he extended his thanks to the Company Secretary, Head of Communications, the Finance Team and the External Auditors for their efforts in maintaining a robust process both throughout the year and for the year-end processes. 

He added that in relation to the Head of Internal Audit Opinion for 2024/25, an overall opinion of Significant Assurance had been provided. It was noted that the Head of Internal Audit Opinion was one of the sources of assurance used by the Board to produce the annual governance statement included in the annual report. He commented on the excellent collaboration between the Trust and Internal Auditors this year. 

He informed the Board that due to changes to the General Accounting Manual this year there would be a delay in the External Auditors issuing the audit certificate but this would not preclude the Board from adopting the accounts at this meeting and their submission to NHS England by noon on 30 

June 2025. 

The Audit Committee was recommending that the Trust Board adopt the annual report and accounts for 2024-25. This conclusion had been supported by the External Auditors’ opinion on the accuracy of the financial statements. 

**Item 2025-26 \(54 a, b, and c\)**

**Discussion points: Annual report and accounts 2024/25 **

On 23 June 2025, the Audit Committee had received the Audit Completion Report and reviewed the draft letter of representation on the Trust’s financial statements issued by the external auditors, Forvis Mazars. 

The Executive Director of Finance and Resources confirmed that, as noted in the draft letter of representation, directors had provided written confirmation that, to the best of their knowledge, all information relevant to the financial statements had been disclosed. The External Auditors had confirmed their confidence that this had been the case. 

Referring to the external auditors’ opinion on the accounts, the Executive Director of Finance and Resources said she could report that the auditors would issue an unqualified opinion on the Trust’s Page 3 of 4

accounts and there were no significant concerns on the value for money statements. She highlighted that some non-material further changes to the remuneration report had been suggested by the External Auditors, but she was able to confirm that the changes would not impact on the primary financial statements or the financial results and would not preclude the Trust Board signing off the annual report and accounts at this meeting. 

In addition, due to some changes to the process by the National Audit Office, certification of the accounts would not be possible at this time however this would not change the auditor’s overall opinion on the Trust’s accounts but could potentially impact on the Value for Money commentary. 



A more streamlined programme management approach this year had led to the production of a more cohesive report. 

The Board placed on record its thanks to all members of the Trust’s staff who had contributed to the timely completion of the annual report and accounts for 2024/25, and the External Auditors for their efforts in maintaining a robust process both throughout the year and for the year-end processes. 

**Outcome:** the Board accepted the recommendations of the Audit Committee and:

• adopted the draft annual report and accounts \(as supported by the external auditors’ 

opinion\) subject to further non-material changes 

• approved the letter of representation, which, amongst other matters, required that the Trust Board considered and agreed that there are no “events after the reporting period” to include in the accounts and bring to the auditor’s attention

• following the Trust Board approval, the Chief Executive and Interim Executive Director of Finance and Resources’ e-signatures would be applied to relevant documents for submission to NHS England on or before noon on the 30 June 2025. 

**Item 2025-26 \(55\)**

**Discussion points:**

**Quality Account 2024/25 **

The Deputy Director of Nursing & Quality and Director of Infection Prevention and Control presented the final draft of the Quality Account 2024/25 for approval. 

The Board noted that the final version reflected the comments and suggestions made following a review by the Quality Committee in May 2025. 

The Board placed on record its thanks to all staff who had contributed to producing the Quality Account for 2024/25 which was a substantial piece of work. 

**Outcome: the Board **

• approved the Quality Account for publication by 30 June 2025. 

**Item 2025-26 \(56\)**

No matters were raised.

**Declarations of interest**

Prior to the Trust Board meeting, the Deputy Trust Chair had considered the Directors’ declarations of interest register and the agenda content to ensure there was no known conflict of interest prior to papers being distributed to Board members. 

No other additional declarations were made above those on record or in respect of any business covered by the agenda. 

**Item 2024-25 \(59\)**

**Discussion points:**

**Green Plan Refresh 2025-2028**

The Executive Director of Finance and Resources introduced the refreshed Green Plan on behalf of the Sustainability Manager. She explained that since the previous Green Plan 2022-2025, emissions had steadily increased and therefore the refresh was focused on projects which would result in an emissions decline to ensure the Trust was meeting the requirements set by the Greener NHS team. 

This would bring the net zero ambition forward to 2040, although the challenges to achieving that target were acknowledged. 

The Board was informed that the plan proposed that an Adaptability and Sustainability Steering Group would be formed, in order to ensure sustainability becomes a golden thread throughout business processes and investment decisions. Wider staff engagement was essential, to support the Sustainability Manager. 

Board members were invited to make a collective and personal pledge, including moving away from paper Board and Committee packs in favour of a digital format. It was acknowledged that this would also need to be applied to wider business processes, but modelling at Board level was welcomed. 

Page 2 of 3

Committee representatives from People and Culture, Business and Quality Committees each welcomed the plan and commented on discussions held at Committees focussing on different elements of the plan such as staff engagement and shared ownership, and clinical waste. 

A brief discussion was held regarding champion roles, in general and in relation to the Green Plan, which it was felt needed more rigour and supporting principles. Further work on this would be done through the Leaders Network. 

The Executive Director of Finance and Resources thanked the Sustainability Manager for their hard work in pulling the refreshed plan together. 

Outcome: the Board

•

Felt assured that the actions within the plan would bring about emission decline and ensure the Trust met the compulsory requirements outlined by the Greener NHS team. 

•

Discussed the feasibility and increased ambition of the net zero trajectory of 2040, considering the available resources, capital and staffing in the sustainability department. 

•

Acknowledged the limited capital for ambitious projects to decarbonise. Discussed tactics and prioritisation to maximise progress with limited resources. 

•

Approved the proposal to commence a Director led Sustainability and Climate Adaptability Steering Group. 

**Item 2024-25 \(60\)**

**Discussion points:**

**Any other business and Close **

The Executive Director of Finance and Resources provided an update on the digital letters issue, which had been highlighted at the private Board on 5 June 2025. 

The Board was informed that the clinical risk had been reviewed during June, and the EQIA for the project was also to be reviewed in light of the issues. 

In the interests of full transparency, the Information Commissioner’s Office had been notified of the issue, along with the Care Quality Commission. 

Contractual implications were being reviewed and legal advice had been sought. 

Outcome: the Board noted the update.

**Chief Executive’s Report**

**1**

**Introduction**

The purpose of this report is to update and inform the Board of key activities and issues from the Chief Executive. Due to the timing of the board and annual leave there will be a verbal update at the Board meeting for any more recent 

announcements. 

**2**

**Our Services and Our People**

**Veteran Aware**

We are delighted to announce that the Trust has received its Veteran Aware accreditation. Thanks to everyone involved in the work to achieve this which is an important signal to the work we do to value our veteran’s community. 

**Trust Leaders Network**

Shortly after commencing with the Trust, we were asked to re-launch a monthly network for leaders across the Trust to come together to receive and share key information that those in leadership roles find valuable. We have now run two sessions – the last one in August was attended by over 80 people with contributions from across different departments. We will continue to develop this as an important space for sharing national and local intelligence and internal updates. Board members are very welcome to join the network. 

**Industrial Action**

Resident doctors took industrial action from 7am Friday 25 July to 7am Wednesday 30 July. 90% of BMA members voted in favour of taking industrial action on a 55% 

turnout. The mandate lasts until January 2026 and the dispute is with the government on pay and conditions. Negotiations have resumed and at the time of writing there have been no further announcements of industrial action – the BMA are required to give a minimum of two weeks’ notice. 

Thanks to everyone involved who managed and coordinated our response to the industrial action which resulted in minimal disruption and no patient safety incidents in the Trust. 

**Trust Annual General Meeting**

Our trust annual reports have been laid before parliament and plans have been finalised for us to hold our annual general meeting. This will be held on the 16 

September at 12.30pm, held at The Vinery in Leeds and a calendar invite will come out to board members’ diaries. We look forward to seeing everyone there. 

**Medium Term Planning**

NHS Trusts will be expected to develop medium-term plans before the end of this 

year that will then span 2026-2029. Guidance is being developed, and we expect to understand more on what will be required by October. We will bring further information to the November Board meeting, assuming the guidance has been published by then.

**Leeds System Update**

**NHS England Chair Penny Dash visit to Leeds **

The chair of NHSE Penny Dash visited Leeds on 8 July 2025. Following a tour at 

Leeds General Infirmary a small group of representatives from health and care in the city joined Penny for lunch to discuss the 10-year plan and the work underway in the city. 

**Leeds Provider Partnership Review **

The Leeds Provider Partnership Review commissioned by NHS providers, Leeds City 

Council, and the ICB is well underway, and Dr Ruth Burnett and Dan Barnett represent the Trust on the operational steering group that meets weekly. 

The first phase focused on reviewing key documentation, including organisational strategies and interviews with a range of stakeholders. The second phase is more focused on potential scenarios for how we work together – partnership governance, mutual accountability, integrated models that will support neighborhood health and address current risks and issues being experienced by statutory organisations, implications of changes to the ICB and NHSE for providers. 

Now the 10-year plan for health has been published this will be explicitly considered in the blueprint we want to create for the city and what the roadmap should look like to achieve this. We have also asked that learning from work underway in other systems is included. The aim is still to have a draft report by the end of September. 

**Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust leadership update**

The new chair of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust \(LTHT\), Mr Antony Kildair has now commenced in post and is meeting with partners as part of his induction. Having met Antony, it was a good opportunity to brief him on our approach to partnership working in the city and the importance of this continuation as a priority for the new leadership team at LTHT. 

Professor Phil Wood – CEO at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has announced 

his intention to retire at the end of this year. Phil will remain committed to the Leeds Provider Partnership development during this time, and this will be one of the priority areas of work for his future successor. 

Deputy CEO and Chief Operating Officer Clare Smith has been successful in getting the CEO post at York and Scarborough acute trust and will soon be leaving Leeds. 

Interim arrangements will be put in place as permanent recruitment will not take place until a new CEO is appointed for LTHT. 

**National Neighbourhood Health Pilot**

ICBs and places have been invited to apply to be one of 42 pilot sites to test, learn and grow models of neighbourhood health. There is no limit to the number of applications from ICBs, but they must be endorsed by all partners, the ICB and the elected mayor. Three bids have been endorsed for West Yorkshire – including a bid by Leeds which will involve a select number of PCNs as the footprint. We will update at the Board meeting on the timescales for when we hear if our application has been successful.

**Regional and National Updates**

The most notable update since our last Board meeting is the publication of the **10 **

**year plan** for health, coinciding with the NHS 77th birthday. The Board has been sent links to the plan separately. 

The plan sets out a future model of provision which has shifted significantly in the use of AI and technology to enable care delivery, service delivery, support staff etc. 

Some key updates to note:

• Further guidance on the implementation of the 10-year plan is being 

developed. 

• The foundation trust model will be relaunched, and mature systems will be 

able to develop as an integrated health organisation where population 

budgets are collectively managed. 

• Move to medium term financial planning and capital planning is welcomed. 

• Anticipate further changes to the funding and payment mechanisms for 

providers. 

• The development of a blueprint for NHS England regional teams has still not 

been published. 

• The timescale for changes to Integrated Care Boards is still to be confirmed. 

• The progress of the new MHA to receive royal assent is expected to now take 

place in the autumn. 

• A new workforce strategy is expected in the autumn. 

• Development of modern service frameworks will begin later in the year to set 

out more detailed strategy on service areas including mental health. 

NHS CEOs were asked to volunteer to help with the development of detailed implementation guidance over the next few months and the following workstreams 

have been established:

• Neighbourhood health

• NHS app and single patient record

• Oversight model, foundation trust and model integrated health organisation

• Financial foundations and medium-term planning

• Quality

• Workforce

Having volunteered for several of these I have now been asked to join the workforce workstream. 



The second phase of the review by Penny Dash into the **quality and safety** **regulatory** landscape for health and care was also published in July. Key headlines include abolition of Healthwatch and the National Guardian’s Office. The Freedom to Speak Up Guardian role will however remain at provider level. Consolidation of different safety regulatory functions is recommended e.g. Health Services Safety Investigations Body \(HSSIB\) to be incorporated into the Care Quality Commission. 

There will be a relaunch of the national quality board and publication of a new national quality strategy for the NHS. 

Page 4 of 5

**National Oversight Framework \(NOF\)**

NHS England consulted on the development of a new NOF for providers and ICBs 

earlier this year. It is also being referred to as the provider assessment framework/score \(PAF/PAS\). The consultation has concluded, and all NHS providers are being assessed under the new framework and scored in segments from 1-4. The level a Trust is in determines the level of oversight/intervention that will be provided by NHSE regional teams. One is the highest/best segment – 4 is the lowest. 

For Trusts in segment 3/4 they will be required to produce and agree recovery plans with NHSE, monitored against agreed milestones. For Trusts who are not able to 

improve as planned/expected, there may be further reviews of organisational capability. Trusts that are deemed not to have the capability to improve can be placed in a new segment of 5. Trusts currently in special measures will be placed in segment 5. Any Trust in receipt of deficit support financially cannot be higher than segment 3. 

NHSE has finalised these new segments, and we are advised they will be published on 11 September 2025. Work is well underway to understand our own metrics and 

where we need to prioritise improvement and to prepare for publication. This will be discussed further in the private board session. 

**Provider Capability Assessments**

At the time of writing this paper I have just received notification that NHSE is introducing a new provider capability self-assessment framework. The template is expected before the end of August and Boards will have two months to complete and return the assessment to NHSE. 

The capability assessment will be based around:

•

an annual self-assessment by provider boards submitted to NHS England, with 

supporting evidence, based on themes from last year's publication of The  

Insightful Board. 

•

a review of the self-assessment, triangulated with NHS England views of the 

provider and any third-party information, to provide an overall view of capability. 

•

across the year, NHS England will use the capability assessment to inform their relationship with the provider, including revising the capability rating should events require it. 

It is intended that the capability rating will be published alongside the quarter 2 

2025/26 NOF segmentation during quarter 3 and the outputs used to determine the 

level of oversight, support and intervention from NHSE to providers. Further detail will be shared once received and we will agree at the Board meeting our approach to completing the self-assessment and Board sign off before submission.

1. Introduction 

Winter places significant and sustained pressure on health and care services across the system. This Winter Plan outlines how Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust \(LCH\) will prepare for and respond to these chal enges to maintain safe, high-quality, and resilient services for the people of Leeds. This plan aligns with and directly feeds into the system level ICB plan. Winter pressures in the context of this plan include an increase in referrals/service demand due to increased system flow, a general increase in respiratory infections, adverse weather events and increased staff unavailability/absence. 

Key priorities for this winter for LCH include: 



• Strengthening community pathways to support system flow 

• Balancing urgent care with waiting list management 

• Enhancing workforce capacity and resilience through rota planning and wellbeing support 

• Increasing utilisation of data to monitor demand and manage escalation 

• Clear communication with staff, partners, and patients on service changes and pressures 

• Ensuring that ongoing restructures linked to the current Quality and Value \(Q&V\) programme do not negatively impact service delivery 

• Managing workplace sickness and absence 

• Mitigating and responding to the impact of potential strike action 

1.1 Services in Scope 



Each service area that experiences increased demand during winter or is directly affected by system flow has contributed to this plan. Contributions are based on expected seasonal pressures, learning from previous years, and current forecasts for the upcoming winter period. The following services have been included: 



ABU 

Neighbourhood Teams 

Home Ward Frailty 

Transfer of Care Services \(Community Discharge Assessment Team, Bed 

Bureau, TOC\) 

Health Case Management 

Community Therapy Service \(Patient Flow Services, Active Recovery\) 

Wharfedale/Community Care Beds 



CBU

Children’s CIVAS 



SBU 

Home Ward Respiratory 

Community Stroke Rehabilitation Team 

Community Intravenous Administration Service \(CIVAS\) 

Homeless and Health Inclusion Team 



OPS 

Administration Services 





Other services, including Children’s Community Nursing, were engaged during the 

development of this Winter Plan. However, as their current pressures are not considered to be specifically seasonal, they have not been included in this iteration. For future planning, all 2 





services should be contacted again to ensure any emerging pressures are 

identified and all relevant areas are appropriately reflected. 

2. Risks, Capacity and Demand 

Winter presents a range of operational risks and pressures that may impact the Trust’s ability to maintain safe and effective service delivery. Key overarching risks include an increase in staff sickness absence, a high surge in referrals and demand across key services, and potential disruption to the Trust’s physical infrastructure and external factors such as severe weather and 4x4 availability. 



2.1 Key Risks by Service 

The table below summarises the anticipated pressures for each service during Winter 2025/26, detailing service-specific risks, projected impacts, and the mitigation measures in place to manage demand while maintaining safe, effective care. Key demand data from Winter 2024/25, provided in Appendix 1, has informed the planning within this section.

2.2 System generated risks 

System risks for this coming winter have been identified in terms of inappropriate/early discharge without appropriate support in place. TOC to pilot supporting discharge flow out of Wharfedale CCB to support the delays, liaising with system partners to expedite delays and reduced no reason to reside lengths of stay. The system risks contributing to delays include the demand for Adult Social Care \(ASC\) colleagues for social work assessments, housing delays due to a significant shortage of housing options available in the city and delays to Decision Support Tool assessments from Continuing Healthcare 



LTHT is forecasting higher bed and ward occupancy than in previous years, driven by increased planned elective surgery and elevated summer occupancy levels. This is likely to result in more referrals and greater demand for LCH services.

2.3 Surge Planning 

In the event of a surge, individual services will manage flow based on patient need, applying cohorting arrangements and established escalation processes \(see Section 3\). The table below outlines how key services in the plan will manage patient flow in the event of surge. 

**Service **

**Average \+10% \+20% \+30% Impact and Mitigation **

Daily NT performance is monitored by leadership across ABU to 

**Teams \(13 NTs\) **

\(week\) 

track demand entering the triage hubs. The immediate pressure 

point is in the Triage Hubs, where the target is to screen referrals 

within 24 hours to determine priority based on patient need and 

cohorts. Importantly, referral volumes do not equate to all patients 

being directed to Neighbourhood Teams, nor are al patients 

medically fit for discharge at the point of referral. 

To manage winter surges, a proposal has been made for two 

additional Band 6 centrally funded triage clinicians. These roles 

will strengthen referral management capacity and support 

responsive care calls during peak demand. 

During surge, the triage hub escalation process is activated, and 

resources are mobilised to key pressure points to maintain patient 

flow. Demand is assessed both at the neighbourhood level and 

across the city to ensure targeted support for the teams most 

affected. For example, where one area experiences 

disproportionately higher demand, resources are redeployed 

accordingly to maintain equity of service. There is also close 

coordination with the TOC and the LTHT Lead Nurse for Discharge 

and Transfer of Care to support timely and safe patient transitions.

increased demand. 

During surge periods, priority is given to urgent cases by allocating 

the 15 available slots accordingly. The service also retains the 

flexibility to create additional slots where required; however, this 

has a knock-on effect on overall waiting times within the 

professions from which these slots are drawn.

These are reviewed and updated annually and al services contributing to this winter plan have confirmed that their BCPs have been updated to ensure timely and effective escalation procedures are in place. BCPs have been Audited in August 2025. 

**OPEL Framework:** 

While currently under review and subject to future change, LCH continues to operate an internal Operational Pressures Escalation Levels \(OPEL\) framework, categorising service pressure from Level 1 to Level 4. Services can update their status daily, and this feeds into a daily cascade shared with relevant Trust leaders. LCH also contributes to the external 9 





system-wide OPEL reporting process to support the monitoring of wider system 

pressures. Any changes to the internal framework wil be reflected in an updated version of this plan. ** **

**Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response \(EPRR\):** 

LCH has a suite of Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response \(EPRR\) plans 

including pandemic planning. These should be used in conjunction with the Trust’s on-call procedures and service-level BCPs to ensure a coordinated and resilient response to emerging risks or incidents. As part of this suite LCH maintains a formal Incident Response Plan, which aligns with local, regional, and national emergency planning frameworks. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable to a range of scenarios. 

3.2 On Call Arrangements 



The Trust maintains a 24/7 senior manager on-call function throughout the year, ensuring timely leadership support for urgent operational issues and incident response. This consists of a first and second on-call manager, operating on a weekly rota system. The first on-call manager acts as the initial point of contact for most calls and is responsible for managing operational queries and incidents as they arise. Where necessary, they wil escalate to the second on-call manager for senior oversight, advice, reassurance, or the establishment of a formal command structure. The on-call manager can be contacted via the dedicated number: **0845 265 7599**. 



The on-call arrangements are designed to provide an immediate out-of-hours response and ensure safe and effective service continuity until normal business hours resume. These arrangements form a key part of the Trust’s EPRR infrastructure and ensure that operational decision-making and escalation can happen. 

3.3 Coordination and Oversight 

The operational elements set out in this framework are overseen through established Trust governance structures. During the winter period, the Trust wil maintain regular oversight through its internal business unit structures, performance panels, operational command arrangements, and winter planning leads. 



Issues and escalations identified through OPEL reporting, business continuity triggers, or via the on-call system wil be reviewed and escalated as necessary through Bronze, Silver and Gold command structures, in line with the Trust’s EPRR and Incident Response 

arrangements. 

4. Staffing and Workforce 

LCH has effective, stable Temporary Worker Bank arrangements, and has increased both the number of people on the bank, and the fil rate of bank shifts, over the past 3 years. 

Agency should always be a last resort, once all internal options have been explored \(bank, additional hours\). LCH has existing arrangements with a range of Framework providers where needed, for clinical workers. Non-clinical agency workers wil not normally be approved. 

There is a Staff Mobility / Workforce Sharing protocol available for use across Leeds, which could be particularly useful for urgent Mutual Aid situations. Clear rostering guidelines and protocols are in place, to enable services to plan-in-advance to ensure appropriate capacity is available, including the management of safe staffing levels and planned absences.

winter period. Sickness levels remained 

below the 16-month average of 5.5%.

Our overarching Admin Services are preparing for staff with mutual skil s to work across specific areas who experience winter pressures. A review of C1/2/3 activity is also taking place in preparation for winter to aid in moving staff to C1 activity where necessary. The Children’s services aligned to this plan are also carefully managing rotas abd annual leave to ensure full coverage and have internal arrangements within the service to move staff if required due to higher rate of absences or service need. 

4.2 Sickness and Absence Management 

LCH is launching a focused project to strengthen sickness and absence management, ensuring optimal staffing levels throughout the winter period. Initial work has commenced through targeted *Sickness Deep Dives* with services recording the highest absence rates. 

Building on these insights, further actions wil be implemented to minimise service disruption and maintain safe, effective care during peak seasonal pressures. Sickness data for the services covered in this plan over the last year is provided in Appendix 2.

5. Adverse Weather Preparedness 

In 2024 LCH produced specific Adverse Weather Plan, which is part of a suite of Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response \(EPRR\) plans which have been developed to 

provide the framework by which LCH wil respond to specific incidents\\events. 

Adverse weather planning should also feature as part of service BCPs and have been reviewed this year in line with this plan. Below is a summary of the Trust’s local adverse weather preparedness arrangements.

and/or board level, concerns can be in

9. Vaccination Strategy 

Plans are in place for the Winter Flu Staff Vaccination Programme in line with Criterion 10 of the Health and Social Care Act Code of Practice \(2008, updated 2022\). During winter 2024/2025, LCH achieved a 49% staff flu vaccination rate. For 2025/2026, the target is 54%, 17 





as outlined in the National Flu Immunisation Programme Letter from NHS 

England, aiming for a 5% increase on last year’s figures. 



Collaboration with colleagues from the Organisational Development and Inclusion \(ODI\) team wil be central to driving uptake. Working together, we aim to influence attitudes and behaviours by addressing misconceptions, building confidence, and promoting the benefits of vaccination for both staff and patients. Through tailored messaging, inclusive communication strategies, and targeted engagement activities, the campaign seeks to change hearts and minds across the workforce. This partnership ensures that messaging is accessible, supportive, and resonates with diverse staff groups, ultimately supporting higher vaccine uptake across the Trust. 



Flu vaccinations have been ordered via Moorhouse Medicines Management at LTHT and are scheduled for delivery in mid-September to Chapeltown Health Centre, with a proposed campaign start date of early October 2025. A detailed GANTT/Project Plan is in place, outlining a week-by-week schedule to track campaign progress. The IPC Team wil engage bank staff in August to support vaccine delivery and begin planning rotas and any required training. 



Staff wil be invited to book vaccination appointments via the Casandra internal booking system, where all campaign data wil also be recorded and monitored in real time. Work is underway to identify Flu Champions across each business unit to promote the campaign local y, with a specific focus on hard-to-reach teams such as Night Services and Custody Suite staff. Engagement with the Executive Team is ongoing to encourage leadership support and visibility. A combination of existing campaign materials and videos wil be reused, supplemented by new resources where possible. 



Consideration is also being given to the use of incentives to encourage uptake; however, evidence suggests these are most effective when combined with clear communication and strong leadership endorsement. 



Final y, system-wide collaboration continues, with benchmarking of innovative ideas and best practice across partner organisations. A weekly collaborative system meeting wil monitor progress, share insights, and review uptake figures across the region. 



10. Fit Testing 

To ensure the health, safety, and wel being of staff and to maintain full compliance with Infection Prevention and Control \(IPC\) standards, as stipulated in the *Health and Social Care* *Act: Code of Practice* \(2008, updated 2022\) and the Health and Safety Executive \(HSE\) INDG479 guidance, LCH operates a comprehensive fit testing programme for relevant clinical and frontline staff. This programme ensures that respiratory protective equipment \(RPE\) is both suitable and correctly fitted, thereby safeguarding staff during periods of heightened clinical risk. 

The fit testing process is currently transitioning to a fully digital, in-house platform, developed by Coreshare, with a phased rollout commencing in September 2025. The platform wil be accessible via the Power BI application and has been designed to streamline and strengthen governance around fit testing by incorporating: 

• A mandatory risk assessment for all clinical and frontline staff to determine individual fit testing requirements. 

18 





• An integrated booking system enabling staff to schedule fit testing 

appointments directly. 

• Delivery of quantitative fit testing undertaken in-house by appropriately trained personnel. 

Initial trials of the system are currently underway within the Dental and LSH services ahead of wider implementation. The platform wil feature an automated daily data import from ESR, ensuring that staffing information — including starters and leavers — remains accurate and up to date. Furthermore, the system’s integrated data reporting functionality via Power BI wil enhance monitoring, enable efficient oversight, and ensure ongoing compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. 

The Pie Chart below shows the number of staff fit tested per business unit by 2024-25. 





11. Outbreak Management and System Response 

LCH has established robust procedures for the early identification, management, and containment of outbreaks across all services. These procedures are fully aligned with national guidance, including the *UK Health Security Agency \(UKHSA\)* framework, and are supported by the Infection Prevention and Control \(IPC\) team’s expertise to minimise disruption, protect patients and staff, and ensure the continuity of safe, effective care. 

In addition, LCH works in close partnership with Leeds City Council \(LCC\) and wider system partners through a formal Cooperation Agreement to ensure a coordinated, system-wide response to outbreaks. This collaborative approach enables: 

• Real-time information sharing across system partners to facilitate rapid action. 

19 





• Joint decision-making regarding outbreak control measures and 

resource deployment. 

• Consistent communication of public health messages and guidance. 

• Integration of outbreak response plans across LCH, LCC, and other system 

stakeholders. 

This coordinated system response strengthens resilience across health and care services, ensuring that outbreak management remains timely, effective, and aligned with both local and national requirements. 

A specific outbreak management plan for LCH has been developed along with the Roles and Responsibilities matrix for the system response to outbreaks. 

12. Bank Holiday and Christmas period planning 

A full list of festive building and service opening hours wil be circulated to On Cal Managers in early December by the Facilities Team. 

Any specific arrangements wil be shared with staff that have on-call responsibilities over the Christmas and New Year Holiday Period. Christmas on-call arrangements are now split between on call managers with additional changeovers to ensure that the responsibilities are shared fairly. The Trust’s arrangements wil also be shared with the system through circulation of the ICB System Christmas and New Year Bank Holiday Plan. 

13. Evaluation plan 

LCH wil monitor the effectiveness of the Winter Plan through weekly 30-minute huddles with each of the three business units, providing a structured forum to identify emerging pressures, escalations, and support needs in real time. Insights from these huddles wil feed into wider system planning and enable responsive decision-making. At the end of the winter period, a debrief workshop wil be held with representation from across the Trust to review what worked well, identify areas for improvement, and inform future seasonal planning. This wil be held in late April to allow information to be fed into the wider system evaluation workshops in May.

**Health Equity Strategy**

**1**

**Introduction**

As an NHS Trust, LCH has statutory requirements to address inequity. Alongside this, the trust has made an ongoing commitment to identifying and addressing inequity in its care and pathways that contribute to wider inequity in health. Through the approach of a SWOT analysis, this paper provides an update on the progress against our strategic goal of equity and our statutory obligations, and considers how they are contributing to value as well as quality agenda. 

**2**

**Current position**

**2.1**

**Strengths**

•

**Implementation of Internal Audit recommendations**

Following the Internal Audit in December 2024, the improvement actions have been delivered, namely: the revised Health Equity Leadership Group has senior leader 

representation from all Business Units; training has been delivered on the use of equity dashboards; resourcing for the delivery of the health equity action plan has been increased and; population health management data is now available to LCH staff and training has been delivered. This has supported renewed momentum and the funding of additional capacity. The EQIA process has been rigorously embedded within the quality and value programme; EQIA training continues to be delivered with increased familiarity with the processes across the organisation. Review of EQIA processes in line with audit 

recommendations have further strengthened processes and governance with further work underway to align with workforce impacts and processes. LCH EQIA processes are looked to as a strong example in the city. 

•

**Armed forces covenant**

A year ago, LCH signed the Armed Forces Covenant, pledging our commitment to 

addressing disadvantage that members of the Armed Forces community \(those currently serving, reservists, veterans and family members\) may face when using our services or working for LCH. We have passed our one-year accreditation review, being recognised by the national team for the work of the Armed Forces Steering Group to bring together subject specialists and people with lived experience to drive forward our work. 

•

**Racial equity in care**

The Racial Equity in Care Group is co-chaired by the Director of Nursing, AHPs and Quality and a member of the staff Race Equality Network. It enables us to deliver our statutory requirements under the Patient and Carer Race Equality Framework \(PCREF\) for our mental health services and expand learning and improvements in racial equity in our other services. The first three areas of focus where there is nationally- and locally-recognised racial inequity are: Black men’s mental health; sexual health and; maternity. This established group will also contribute to associated improvement work such as Interpreting and Translation. 

•

**Leeds Healthcare Inequalities Oversight Group **

A priority that has consistently emerged from the Trust Board in relation to health equity is for LCH to increase partnership working and strengthen its alignment with citywide initiatives. In February 2025, the Leeds Healthcare Inequalities Oversight Group was established. This group comprises of senior leaders and inequalities experts from across Page 2 of 5



the city, its purpose being to ensure tackling healthcare inequalities is embedded within every aspect of decision-making, resource allocation and service delivery across healthcare in Leeds. It is ultimately about making equity core business within healthcare. LCH has been pivotal in establishing the group and contributing to its progress. The group will be considering how we align and strengthen EQIA processes across the city to examine impacts on communities at risk of poor health outcomes. 

•

**Improvement examples**

LCH’s new Information Hub makes information about our services and managing health conditions more accessible and inclusive. This includes a redesign of information, increased focus on self-management materials, expansion of Easy read resources and a suite of accessibility tools. This is vital when in Leeds, 42% of working-age adults are unable to 

understand or make use of everyday health information, rising to 62% when numeracy skills 

are also required for comprehension.  This work goes alongside a digital inclusion programme of training for staff, EPR screening tool and partnership working with 100% 

Digital Leeds. It supports services to signpost to a greater range of resources that can meet wide variety of communication and literacy needs, acting as an enabler for service redesigns that meet our equity ambitions. 

When Podiatry made changes to the service, they had a focus on ensuring communication was clear, widely-shared and accessible. This included two different methods of direct communication with patients as well as sharing information about the change itself with patients, stakeholders and key sources of support / advocacy. Alongside this, they signposted to self-management guidance as well as sources of practical and financial support. 

**2.2**

**Weaknesses **

•

**Inequity in waiting lists**

Recent publication of equity lenses on national waiting list data identifies that patients in the poorest communities and those from an Asian or Asian British background are more likely to be waiting longer than 18 weeks than any other group. We see inequity in LCH waiting lists too:

-

People from IMD 1 are waiting longer for services in consultant led and non-consultant led lists

-

In the evaluation of the Access LCH initiative to reduce waiting list sizes, there had been an 8% reduction in IMD2-10, but 5% in IMD1 \(most deprived\)

-

In some services, patients in our most deprived communities are currently waiting over 2 

weeks longer on average for a first appointment

•

**Data quality and use**

An equity data question was added to the 

Board and committee cover paper template 

to support chairs to monitor their committee 

performance and content against equity. 

The chart shows the inclusion of equity 

lenses in Board and Committee reports for 

the last 2 years, where data relating to 

patients was provided. Where there is 

equity data missing in papers, this is often 

raised by NEDs, but we are not aware of 

any reference to this section of the cover 

Page 3 of 5

paper within meetings, indicating that the cover sheet question has not yet driven committee change relating to equity. 

**Recommendation**: Chair and Committee Chairs to agree the continuation of the equity data question in Board and Committee paper cover sheets and plan, in discussion with the Exec Lead for Health Equity and Equity Lead, how this could be most effectively utilised going forwards. 

•

**Permeation of messages throughout the organisation **

Recent engagement and surveys identified limited recognition and use of equity resources such as the newly added IMD data to waiting list validation, PIP equity data and missed appointment guidance. Despite equity being better understood, there is an enormous task still to make equity part of usual business/practice. This involves defined roles and responsibilities across the organisations but also training and development. 

**2.3**

**Opportunities**

•

**Equity as a means to improve productivity**

The focus on value and productivity provides an additional way to view the benefits of addressing inequity. In addition to the positive impact on individual access, experience and outcomes and on population health, addressing inequity also provides opportunities to address inefficiencies for example in waiting lists, missed appointments, adverse care incidents and lapses in communication. Equity improvement priorities are therefore focussed on these areas, for example supporting the Access LCH and Quality and Value programmes through missed appointments processes, principles for opt-in, opt-out and Patient Initiated Follow Up \(PIFU\), ‘About Me’ template and digital patient questionnaire, patient information on supporting attendance at appointments and the development of new waiting list events and resources. 

•

**Capacity**

The new Equity and Learning Disability Improvement Manager and Equity Project Support are now in post, supporting delivery and implementation of key equity priorities. This will provide additional capacity to work directly with services and communities. Alongside this increased specialist capacity, the continued development of additional Health Equity Fellows provides increased expertise elsewhere in the trust. 

•

**Health Equity Development Programme **

Through the Leeds Health and Care Academy, over the next two years, Leeds is embarking on a development programme on Health Equity. In its initial design and delivery, it will be predominantly focussed on nurses, midwives and AHPs, with ambition to expand the programme to other roles in the coming years. The programme aims to be a practical, action-orientated scheme, that provides staff with the ability and motivation to act on health equity within their day-to-day roles. This will include embedding equity into clinical practise, examining how health improvement and communication can improve access and 

experience for patients. It will also include clinical leadership levels, focussing more on embedding equity within quality improvement, performance and management. The team development level will provide opportunities for deep engagement with teams, including at LCH, to work together to address priority inequality issues. 

•

**Measurement of equity**

The establishment of the Healthcare Inequalities Oversight Group has provided the opportunity to develop a health equity index that will line up how we measure equity across the city. This in turn will enable LCH to use this methodology in the Integrated Performance Page 4 of 5

Report as a metric for the success of its equity improvements. It will also provide a consistent approach that can be utilised to understand and measure the impact of service changes. 

**Recommendation**: To ensure the inclusion of equity measures in the Integrated Performance Report

**2.4Threats**

The huge system change that is underway risks equity being deprioritised. This, alongside the erosion of health equity and population health responsibilities in the ICB, has the potential for disproportionate impacts on groups at risk of worse health outcomes. Within LCH, the Consultant in Public Health has recently gone on extended leave. A 16-hour post to cover the citywide work that they lead has been agreed, but this will not provide cover for the specialist public health input into the provider trusts. While the equity work will continue, additional input into on the wider prevention agenda will be paused. The changes are significant, but the strengths, capacity and commitment in LCH to identifying and addressing inequity in LCH put us in good stead to take advantage of the opportunities, particularly by focussing on the value as well as quality benefits of equity improvements. 

**3**

**Risk and assurance**

BAF risk 9 describes the risk of failure to prevent harm and reduce inequalities experienced by our patients. If the trust fails to address the inequalities built into its own systems and processes, there is a risk that we are inadvertently causing harm, delivering unfair care and exacerbating inequalities in health outcomes within some cohorts of patients. Delivering the trust’s commitment to embed equity in everything we do ensures that inequity in access, experience, safety and outcomes is identified and addressed. 

**4**

**Next steps**

• Increased engagement with communities and services to develop and promote proactive approaches and mitigations for inequity, with a particular focus on barriers that arise through service change, cultural awareness and competency, communication and reasonable 

adjustments. 

• Resources, citywide and internal workshops on equity in waiting lists

• Recruit cover for Public Health Consultant

**5**

**Recommendations**

The Board is recommended to:

• ensure the inclusion of equity measures in the Integrated Performance Report. 

Chair and Committee Chairs are recommended to

• agree the continuation of the equity data question in Board and Committee paper cover sheets and plan, in discussion with the Exec Lead for Health Equity and Equity Lead, how this could be most effectively utilised going forwards.

**Safe Staffing Report**

➢

**1 Introduction**

In line with the NHS England requirements and the National Quality Board \(NQB\) 

recommendations, this paper presents the six-monthly nursing establishment’s 

workforce review, alongside other staffing data. 

This report will just report on the two in-patient areas which is what is mandated by the NQB for the last 6 months 1 January 2025 to 30 June 2025. 

We continue to use a set of principles to monitor safe staffing in our in-patient beds. 

➢

**2 Current position/main body of the report**

Children’s Business Unit \(CBU\)

Hannah House is the inpatient unit in the CBU. There are currently 3 vacancies \(1 x Band 4 and 2 x B5\) in the team only and there has been increased usage of bank 

staffing during this period. The bank hours utilised in the last 6 month are outlined below. Safe staffing levels have been maintained at all times. 

Band 3 = 984 hours \(101 shifts\)

Band 4 = 34.5 hours \(3 shifts\)

Band 5 = 22.5 hours \(4 shifts\)

Band 6 = 4.25 hours \(1 shift\)

Total Bank = 1045.25 hours 

Increased bank hours were due to sickness \(both short term and long term\) and 

maternity leave in addition to the vacancies. One member of staff left the Trust, however, decided to return and utilised bank hours \(250 hours\) until her substantive position was commenced. Also, we have had new families accessing Hannah 

House and subsequent increases in bed occupancy. 

There have been no complaints. Once staff incident was reported but no harm was 

caused. 

Forty-five nights were cancelled in total during the 6-month period and 91% of the cancellations were due to weather conditions, child illness, hospital admission, parent cancellations and children not ready for admissions. 

Four nights \(9%\) were cancelled due to not having safe levels of staffing and these nights were re-offered immediately for the children in question. 

Page 2 of 3

Adult Business Unit \(ABU\)

Wharfedale recovery hub is a 24/7 bed-based service within the ABU. There are 

currently 5 vacancies \(3 x Band 2, 1 x B5 and 1XB6\) in the team. All Allied Health Professional \(AHP\) vacancies have been filled and are now in post. 

There has been increased usage of bank/agency staffing during this period due to short and long term sickness, maternity leave and vacancies. 

Safe staffing levels have been maintained at all times by using bank/agency. The bank hours utilised in the last 6 month are outlined below:

• Non-registered nursing staffing = 9,914 hours. This includes additional care 

for patients requiring 1:1 enhanced care, which totalled 862 shifts. 

• Registered nursing staffing

Band 5 = 456 hours \(39 shifts\)

Band 6 = 23 hours \(2 shifts\)

Band 6 AHP = 240 hours \(32 shifts\)

Total Bank hours = 10,633.25 hours 

Wharfedale are now participating in the Enhanced Therapeutic Observation of Care \(ETOC\) NHSE improvement work that links to the 1:1 staffing requirements of 

patients requiring ETOC. 

Staff turnover remains stable and staff that have left Wharfedale have been 

successful in securing higher banding roles. 

There have been no complaints during this period with regards to staffing issues. 

➢

**3 Next steps**

This paper provides assurance to Trust Board in relation to safe staffing levels and that these have been maintained in the inpatient units during the last 6 months.

**4 Recommendations**

Trust Board are asked to receive this report and agree the level of assurance

**Name of Committee:**

Business Committee

**Report to:**

Trust Board 4 September 2025

**Date of Meeting:**

28 May 2025

**Date of next meeting:**

25 June 2025

**Introduction**

Quorate meeting. Very good debate with challenging conversations and constructive feedback provided on papers requiring comment. This Committee included a presentation of the Green Plan, the MindMate SPA Business case for approval and the Leeds sexual health online HSJ awards presentation. 

**Alert **

**Action**

**Advise**

• The Committee welcomed and discussed the Green plan and the important contribution the Trust is making to net zero. The Committee discussed the challenges and issues in achieving the plan and were informed that relatively low-cost improvements could contribute to the reduction in carbon emissions in the next few years such as the introduction of solar panels. The Committee asked for a future update of the low-cost improvement plans. 

The Committee agreed, subject to some suggested improvements, the Green plan would be submitted to Board in July. 

• The Committee received the business case proposal to sub-contract delivery of the MindMate SPA service to Northpoint. The Committee discussed the business case including its associated risks and were assured that the Trust had addressed the key risks; for example, patient waiting list volumes, staff issues and financials. The Committee requested that benefits were monitored during the life of the contract so that the Trust could reap the rewards from improvements made e.g. a reduction in costs due to efficiencies made during the current in-life contract. The Committee also discussed the digital solution and agreed it would be beneficial for closer interworking between all parties on the digital improvement plans. The Committee approved the business case submission to Board for final approval. 

• The Corporate Savings Target Submission for NHS England was discussed and approved for submission. 

**Assurance**

• Q&V – The Committee discussed the summary of the report with a focus on programme RAG trends and risk. The Committee welcomed the CIP approach recommended by NHS England and noted that work is underway to assess how it can be applied to the current Q&V programme. The alignment of programme risk and financial risk was also discussed for future reporting improvements. 

• The Committee noted the verbal update on the Neighbourhood model with LCH involvement in the Leeds City Council’s ‘Sounding Board Group’ and the continued ‘Home First’ Programme improvements such as the commissioning of a piece of work to review e.g. earlier interventions. The Committee noted and applauded the achievement of the launch of the Single Care Record which has gone live and requested an update/demonstration at a future Committee. 

Page 1 of 4



**Committee Escalation and Assurance Report** 

• The Committee discussed the NHS Provider Strategic Review with the launch event on May 30 and noted the importance of LCH’s continued involvement alongside all system partners. 

• The Committee received a summary of the organisation strategy development plans with Health Watch and discussed the benefits of feedback loops into the NHS Provider Strategic Review and the Neighbourhood Health model. 

• The Committee noted the updates on the Tenders/Contracts/Commissioners intention including the early notification for the 0-19 service tender in 2026. 

• The Committee discussed the ‘End of Year Trust Priority report’, noted the achievements, and discussed communication improvements of the report for assurance including more on outcomes and presentation style for easier assimilation of the results. 

• The Committee discussed the Performance Management updates including financials. The Committee discussed the HSJ Digital Innovation Award presentation for the Leeds Sexual Health System. It noted the benefit for patients and the community with an innovative digital approach and collaborative use of partners. The Committee discussed the significant efficiencies e.g. 2698 requests since July saved 1058 clinical hours to date. The Committee also suggested reviewing the sustainability benefits e.g. net zero emission savings. The Committee wished the team luck at the awards ceremony\! 

• The Committee noted the progress on Waiting Lists and welcomed the new breakdown in statistics for further assurance on activities, with a request to include these in future reports. 

**Risks Discussed and New Risks Identified**

• The Committee agreed that it had received reasonable assurance against all relevant strategic risks. No new risks identified or discussed.

Trust Board 4 September 2025

**Date of Meeting:**

25 June 2025

**Date of next meeting:**

30 July 2025 

**Introduction**

Quorate meeting. Challenging conversations and constructive feedback provided on papers requiring comment. This Committee included a presentation of the Procurement Strategy, a redrafted Green Plan, and the Neighbourhood model/Community collaborative. 

**Alert **

**Action**

**Advise**

• The Committee welcomed the refresh of the Green plan including the reinvigoration of the Sustainability Pledge campaign and the first pledges to be made by the Trust’s Board Members in July. The Committee applauded the team for being nominated for a national staff benefit award given the Trust’s plans e.g. on ‘green vehicles’ as part of staff benefits and wished the team good luck\! The Committee were assured by the actions and improvements and approved the plan. 

• The Committee discussed the National Cost Collection 2024/5 pre-submission planning report and were assured the report meets the expected requirements. The Committee delegated authority to the Director of Finance to submit the costing submission on 4 July 2025. 

**Assurance**

• Q&V – The Committee applauded the significant assurance given by internal audit. It also welcomed the improvements to reporting including RAG trends and the planned forthcoming updates to address the recommendations from Audit, and NHS England on transformation plans. The Committee noted the achievements in month two. It discussed the risk around achieving the recurring benefit target for the year \(e.g. Corporate and digital programmes\) particularly as significant benefit is forecasted for delivery towards the latter half of the year. The Committee discussed the need for more insight into key outcomes from initiatives including digital. The Committee also discussed the need for a review of the medium-term transformation strategy to set the Trust on a continued positive trajectory. The Committee discussed the cultural engagement of the workforce to move to a business-as-usual modus operandi for transformation. The Committee also noted the requirement for a continued focus on the mitigation of risks arising from transformation ‘fatigue’ and lack of engagement. 

• The Committee received the Procurement Update in support of the Trust’s procurement strategy, working in tandem with Leeds York Partnership Foundation Trust. The Committee were assured that the plan is on track including reviewing system level improvements, and the resourcing to manage the review of twelve strategic projects. The Committee did discuss the benefits realisation and wondered if plans could be accelerated to address the gap. 

The Committee noted the significant ongoing work by all teams involved to improve procurement with a clear cultural shift and approach.

**Committee Escalation and Assurance Report** 

• The Committee discussed the update on the Neighbourhood model/Community Collaborative. The Committee were assured that the programme of work is progressing with four key focus areas for this fiscal: i\) Home First Phase 2, ii\) Community Mental health transformation, iii\) Children and Young People with particularly complex needs and iv\) Early identification of Cardiovascular Disease. The initial focus will be on 2-4% of the population with complex health needs in Leeds. 

• The Committee noted the Provider Partnership review initiative has held workshops to engage with initial stakeholders. 

• The Committee noted the update on the White Rose Park Office lease – discussions are ongoing. 

• The Committee discussed the Finance Report which outlined the year-to-date breakeven position, and the full year forecasted break even position. The Committee noted the Trust’s strong cash position. A focussed discussion centred on recurrent savings and plans to mitigate the risk with the ask for regular updates as the plans develop. 

• The Committee noted an update on Waiting Lists will be presented in July. 

• The Committee noted the Internal Advisory Audit Report for Procurement, and noted there were plans in place to address the improvement advice \(e.g. 

via the procurement strategy and plans\). 

• The Committee discussed the Internal Q&V Audit report, welcomed the significant findings, and recognised there is more work to do to make improvements and were assured plans were in place to address. 

• Risks to escalate to other committees – Given the discussion around potential transformation fatigue in some parts of the organisation, the Business Committee agreed it would raise again to the People and Culture Committee \(P&CC\) with a suggestion for the P&CC to have a ‘deeper dive’ into the root causes and determine actions to address any impacts on culture and engagement. 

**Risks Discussed and New Risks Identified**

• The Committee agreed that it had received reasonable assurance against all relevant strategic risks. No new risks identified or discussed.

**Report to:**

Trust Board 4 September 2025

**Date of Meeting:**

30 July 2025

**Date of next meeting:**

24 September 2025

**Introduction**

Quorate meeting. Robust discussions and constructive feedback provided during the Committee. This Committee included a presentation of the Medium-Term Plan, the Trust’s plan to address the National Oversight Framework, as well as papers covering for example Digital, Third Sector Strategy, Organisational Strategy Development and Risks

**Alert **

**Action**

• Digital Letters – The Committee is concerned about the unknown risk to patient safety. This was A clear prioritised plan to reach resolution, covering also flagged at the Quality Committee. 

potential options for mitigating risks to patient safety, 

business case impact and any feedback from ICO. 

• The Committee discussed a need for urgent action including resolution of the technology issues which will help with any future legal negotiations if needed. Benchmarking with other Trusts who Technology resolution needed – consideration of a can already do digital printing \(phase 1 and 2\) was discussed with current and alternative suppliers credible external independent review with technical who can provide viable solutions. Gaining assurance from Technology partners in writing as to their expertise. 

understanding of the problem and their view of next steps to reach a solution. 

**Advise**

• The Committee welcomed the Medium-Term plan and noted the national shift to a 3-year revenue and 4-year capital spend review. The Committee discussed the pace required over the next few months to firm up this full-scale operational plan. 

• New BAF strategic risks – these were discussed and noted. 

**Assurance**

• Q&V – The Committee welcomed the further improvements to reporting including the addition of the NHSE financial RAG status and YTD versus Forecast. 

The Committee were given some assurance that the programme was on track to breakeven despite the £1.1M slippage YTD. The Committee discussed the need to understand the disproportionate effects the programme could have on staff and what plans are in place to mitigate any risks. 

• Neighbourhood model/Community Collaborative - The Committee were assured that the programme is now starting to see avenues of funding such as the National Neighbourhood Health implementation programme has asked for bids by the 8 August. The Leeds bid focuses on the city’s 6 priority neighbourhood areas plus Chapeltown with a focus on supporting people with long term health conditions in those neighbourhoods. Assurance was given that there is broad boundary alignment between the priority areas \(based on electoral wards\) and Primary Care Networks. Other funding opportunities included the Delivering Page 1 of 4



**Committee Escalation and Assurance Report** 

100-day missions initiative, and Community Growth and Development Funding. The Committee also discussed the work with Newton on early prevention. 

The Committee suggested it would be good to see a mapping of all the initiatives and plans 

• Provider Partnership review – Committee noted the update on the first phase following stakeholder feedback, resulting in some positive key findings and reflections such as acknowledgement that the system governance needs to be simpler and more joined up; and Clinical outcomes need to be better, being actively led and prioritised in our partnership programmes. The second phase of the programme will result in a 12-month roadmap. The Committee was given some reassurance that the recommendations from the programme should aim to make a difference to Leeds citizens and not just recommendations around organisational form. 

• The Digital Data and Technology Strategy Quarterly update was noted. Committee applauded the successful roll outs, and wondered if the next update could show key milestone plans and direct financial benefit attributable to the updates, aligning where possible with Q&V programmes. 

• The Third Sector Strategy Report was noted and welcomed. The Committee echoed the disappointment in the loss of a long-standing partner - The Market Place 

• The Organisational Strategy development report was noted, with more detail to be provided at the next planned meeting. 

• Performance Report - the Committee requested more detail on deteriorating waiting lists position, and requested not just to focus on 52 week waits. The Committee also discussed the need for waiting list expertise in the organisation and suggested lessons could be learned from Acute Trusts. 

• Finance Report - outlined the year-to-date breakeven position, and the full year forecasted break even position. The Committee noted the ICS is forecasting full delivery of plan thus should receive £49.2M deficit support funding. 

• The National Oversight Framework – Committee welcomed the discussion, noting that LCH was currently in Segment 4. The Committee noted the key drivers for LCH segmentation at present are 52 week waits, staff engagement and sickness absence. The Committee requested if the Trust could obtain more detail from the national team to inform the knowledge gaps around comparator organisations. 

• The Waiting List update was discussed as part of the Oversight plans. The Committee discussed Domain 1. It noted that with Access to Services waits for Neurodevelopment Assessments in CAMHS \(for children over 5\) and dental waits are currently not included in the current framework, but it is expected these will be included in future. In SBU the Committee discussed areas of concern including those services with over a 65 week wait – for example, the Adult speech and language service despite having increased their capacity are having to prioritise and focus on emergency cases i.e. those patients with swallowing difficulties are seen within 2 weeks. The Committee was given some assurance that current models are being reviewed to see if things can be done differently. 

The Committee also discussed in this Domain CAMHS long waits for children with Neuro Developmental issues, and the need to review pathways in conjunction with the wider Leeds area. The Committee noted additional investment of c£700k would be needed to help resolve the PND \(Neurodevelopment Assessment for under 5s\) waiting list. Domain 2 – 2-hour access was above designated target of 70% but ambition was 85-90%. The Committee was given assurance this can be sorted quite quickly with Virtual Ward tweaks to the recording process. Domain 4 - It was noted a more in-depth review would be led by the People and Culture Committee. The Committee noted the plan re sickness rates looking at service deep dives, policy and procedures, and targeted cause analysis. It also noted Staff engagement plans including further data analysis and communications. The Committee noted Domain 5 – with work Page 2 of 4

LCH Performance Brief

**June 2025 and Q1 2025/26**

Introduction

This report highlights key areas of performance; including areas that are performing well, areas where improvement work is underway, and early warning of deteriorating performance. 

Performance is measured across six domains, using indicators selected by the Board at the start of the financial year:

-

Safe - By safe, we mean people are protected from abuse and avoidable harm

-

Caring - By caring, we mean staff involving and treating people with compassion, kindness, dignity, and respect

-

Responsive - By responsive, we mean services are tailored to meet the needs of individual people and are delivered in a way to ensure flexibility, choice, and continuity of care

-

Effective - By effective, we mean that care, treatment, and support received by people achieve good outcomes and helps people maintain quality of life and is based on the best available evidence

-

Well-led - By well-led, we mean leadership, management and governance of the organisation assures the delivery of high-quality person-centred care, supports learning and innovation, and promotes an open and fair culture

-

Finance – Finances are well managed

Performance Summary

The overall picture of performance remains broadly similar. One more measure NHS talking therapies DQMI score is now consistently passing its target. 

Good progress continues to be made in the Trust’ appraisal rate and training compliance as performance continues at its improved level. 

A full data pack of all indicators is provided in Appendix 1

Audit Yorkshire continue to support on a fundamental review of the Trusts performance and accountability systems and processes. The National Oversight Framework \(NOF\) has been released by NHS England within the last month, which will also impact how Trust performance will be assessed and measured. Throughout the remained of this financial year the Performance Brief will be revised to reflect the NOF and the review from Audit Yorkshire. 

Alongside a proposal for a new IPR format, a draft Performance and Accountability Framework to link the Trust vision to measurable outcomes is in the process of being developed. Underpinning this is:

• Proposed revised Terms of Reference for performance management processes to strengthen oversight and learning

• A Governance Summary Template to define roles and escalation routes

• Standardised reporting templates

• a KPI Master Data File mapping each indicator to strategic goals and owners

The work is due to conclude at the end of September.

The Trust failed to meet the 100% in Q1, 

and a number of services remain with 

outstanding checks to complete. Further 

narrative is given below.

Safe

**By safe, we mean people are protected from abuse and **

**avoidable harm**

Summary

The Compliance with Level 1 and 2 Patient Safety Training continues to improve month on month, a request for the inclusion of monitoring this measure specifically via performance is for consideration to ensure teams with lower compliance protect the time for this to be completed. 

The new Patient Incident Management Policy which is due to Clinical and Corporate Policy Group in July, once launched, will include processes for additional monitoring and assurance around actions from Patient Safety Incident Investigations. This will include actions being added as a risk to the risk register. PSII actions should be monitored to ensure these do not go overdue and evidence that the action taken meets the requirement of the action with evidence of implementation. Actions will be audited to close the loop and provide assurance that learning has been embedded before the risk is closed. 

Following the review of the Patient Safety Incident Response Plan for 2025/26 Pressure Ulcers, Falls Meatal Tears and Clinical Triage Incident have been removed from the PSIRP priorities it is therefore proposed that this KPI is removed from Performance Reporting for 2025/26 as previously agreed. 

The Trust has been compliant with all statutory duty of candour in this reporting period. 

The Central Alert System \(CAS\) Notification for the medical beds, trolleys, bed rails, bed grab handles and lateral turning devices: risk of death from entrapment or falls remains overdue. Monthly strategy meetings continue to review the outstanding actions and the progress against each of these across the three clinical business units. This is co-ordinated by the Medical Device Safety Officer as the subject matter expert who is responsible for collating the updated position which is then uploaded by the Patient Safety Team to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\). 

The Adult Business Unit are monitoring reporting numbers of staff trained, numbers on caseload to be re assessed using new risk template and numbers of new patients assessed via the monthly performance report. 

Indicator Updates

This section gives updates on specific indicators that meet criteria in the Safe Domain. 





**Compliance in Level 1 and 2 Safety Training **

**What is the trend that we see? **

The data continues to show an improving picture over the last 10 months between September 2024-June 2025 however this remains below the 95% target. 

**What is being done about it? **

This should be monitored via the performance panels in teams as part of the statutory and mandatory training. On review of the performance template all statutory and mandatory training is grouped together with subject compliance not reported on individually. This will need to be considered to ensure monitoring and prioritisation for teams/staff who have not completed this. Request from this report for this to be considered for future performance reporting. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

When the above has been considered and implemented. Proposed timeframes will be considered with Business Unit colleagues. 

7





**Number of overdue PSII actions **

**What is the trend that we see? **

Patient safety incident investigation actions are not being completed within the allocated timescale and are becoming overdue without escalation or request for extensions as per the established process in advance of the due date. There are currently six overdue PSII actions \(one March, one April and four June\), all linked to incidents for the Adult Business Unit. 

Three of the actions relate to deteriorating patient and sepsis- two pending launch of the deteriorating patient policy which is due to SLT week commencing 21st July to be ratified and one action relates to the introduction of the Restore 2 soft signs of sepsis tool which is being trialled in practice for end user feedback before going live on SystmOne. The remaining three actions will require an update on progress. 

**What is being done about it? **

Overdue PSII actions are included in the monthly business unit reports completed by the Quality Leads to escalate when they are overdue for the business unit to action, this will continue to be monitored and highlighted. The new Patient Incident Management Policy which is due to CCPG in July 2025 includes a process whereby PSII actions will be entered as a risk on the risk register until they are complete and assigned to the Clinical Lead for the business unit with responsibility for oversight. These should be monitored and reviewed regularly to ensure they do not go overdue and where a timescale cannot be met the process for escalation and extension is followed prior to the action becoming overdue. 

All overdue PSII actions have been shared with the Quality Lead for the Adult Business Unit to follow the escalation/extension process. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

When the above process is implemented. Timeframes will be discussed and agreed with Business Unit colleagues. 

8





**Number of incidents by PSIRP priority - Pressure Ulcers**

**What is the trend that we see? **

This KPI provides the number of Pressure Ulcer Incidents which have been closed within the reporting period, the data varies month on month. The data does not give an indication of how many incidents of this type have been reported within that time or those which have been investigated and confirmed that LCH care has contributed to or caused the incident. 

On review, one of the incidents closed in June was identified as related to LCH care which met the criteria for statutory Duty of Candour. 

**What is being done about it? **

Pressure ulcer incidents are reviewed and included in a 6 monthly pressure ulcer report to QAIG as outlined in the Patient Safety Incident Response Plan \(PSIRP\) and any significant incidents for pressure ulcers which have progressed to a Patient Safety Incident Investigation are included in the Patient Safety 6 monthly report. 

Following review of the PSIRP pressure ulcers have been removed from the LCH priorities for 2025/26. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

Due to a pause on the revised KPI’s for this financial year due to the ongoing Well Led Review and the new Audit of Performance from Audit Yorkshire it is proposed that this KPI is removed for future Performance Brief reporting as was the plan for 2025/26. 

**Number of incidents by PSIRP priority - Falls**

9





**What is the trend that we see? **

This KPI provides the number of Falls Incidents which have been closed within the reporting period, the data varies month on month. The data does not give an indication of how many incidents of this type have been reported within that time or those which have been investigated and confirmed that LCH care has contributed to or caused the incident. 

On review, there were no falls incidents identified as related to LCH care. 

**What is being done about it? **

Falls incidents are reviewed and included in a 6 monthly falls report to QAIG as outlined in the Patient Safety Incident Response Plan \(PSIRP\) and any significant incidents for falls which have progressed to a Patient Safety Incident Investigation are included in the Patient Safety 6 monthly report. 

Following review of the PSIRP falls have been removed from the LCH priorities for 2025/26. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

Due to a pause on the revised KPI’s for this financial year due to the ongoing Well Led Review and the new Audit of Performance from Audit Yorkshire it is proposed that this KPI is removed for future Performance Brief reporting as was the plan for 2025/26. 

**Number of incidents by PSIRP priority - Deteriorating Patient**

10





**What is the trend that we see? **

This KPI provides the number of Deteriorating Patient/Sepsis Incidents which have been closed within the reporting period, this data varies month on month. The data does not give an indication of how many incidents of this type have been reported within that time or those which have been investigated and confirmed that LCH care has contributed to or caused the incident. 

On review, there were two incidents identified as related to LCH care which met the criteria for statutory duty of candour. 

**What is being done about it? **

Deteriorating patient incidents will be included in a 6 monthly report to QAIG as outlined in the Patient Safety Incident Response Plan \(PSIRP\) and any significant incidents which have progressed to a Patient Safety Incident Investigation are included in the Patient Safety 6 monthly report. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

Due to a pause on the revised KPI’s for this financial year due to the ongoing Well Led Review and the new Audit of Performance from Audit Yorkshire it is proposed that this KPI is removed for future Performance Brief reporting as was the plan for 2025/26. 

**Number of incidents by PSIRP priority - Meatal Tear**

11





**What is the trend that we see? **

This KPI provides the number of Meatal Tear Incidents which have been closed within the reporting period, this data varies month on month. The data does not give an indication of how many incidents of this type have been reported within that time or those which have been investigated and confirmed that LCH care has contributed to or caused the incident. 

On review there was one incident identified as related to LCH care which met the criteria for statutory duty of candour. 

**What is being done about it? **

Following review of the Patient Safety Incident Response Plan \(PSIRP\) Meatal Tears have been removed from the LCH priorities for 2025/26. This was a service led improvement plan and was expected to be short-term. As there were no recurrent themes and trends on review of the data this was not required to be included for 2025-26. 

A potential reemerging theme has been identified in the Q1 data for 2025/26. A task and finish group has been established within ABU. A risk will be added to the risk register in relation to current delays in meeting the requirement of the catheter pathway to review patients discharged with a catheter within 48 hours. Any incidents reported where this delay in assessment and education has contributed to or caused a meatal tear will be linked. Incidents related to meatal tears will continue to be monitored and reported in the Adult Business Unit Report to QAIG. 

Any significant incidents which have progressed to a Patient Safety Incident Investigation are included in the Patient Safety 6 monthly report. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

Due to a pause on the revised KPI’s for this financial year due to the ongoing Well Led Review and the new Audit of Performance from Audit Yorkshire it is proposed that this KPI is removed for future Performance Brief reporting as was the plan for 2025/26. 

**Clinical Triage in Neighbourhood**

**Teams**

12



**What is the trend that we see? **

This KPI provides the number of Clinical Triage Incidents which have been closed within the reporting period, this data varies month on month. The data does not give an indication of how many incidents of this type have been reported within that time or those which have been investigated and confirmed that LCH care has contributed to or caused the incident. 

There were no incidents identified as related to LCH care

**What is being done about it? **

Following review of the Patient Safety Incident Response Plan \(PSIRP\) Clinical Triage has been removed from the LCH priorities for 2025/26. As there were no recurrent themes and trends on review of the data this was not required to be included for 2025-26. 

There is a risk held on the risk register ID 1307 and any patient specific incidents related to triage are linked to this so this can continue to be monitored. This will continue to be reported in the Adult Business Unit Report to QAIG. 

Any significant incidents which have progressed to a Patient Safety Incident Investigation are included in the Patient Safety 6 monthly report. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

Due to a pause on the revised KPI’s for this financial year due to the ongoing Well Led Review and the new Audit of Performance from Audit Yorkshire it is proposed that this KPI is removed for future Performance Brief reporting as was the plan for 2025/26.

**Number of Medicines Code Assurance Checks completed in last 24 months **

14



**What is the trend that we see? **

Special cause concern in the June 2025 data. 

Twenty-four \(out of 116\) teams who handle medicines have not completed a self-assessment Medicines Code Assurance Check in the last 24 months. 

**What is being done about it? **

There are twenty-one checks overdue. A series of service visits are planned, and the Medicines Optimisation Team will complete the checks with the teams to gain assurance \(rather than reassurance from the self-assessment\):

• CUCS – 9 months overdue; changed base in July 2024 \(check expected to be completed within three months of change of location\); awaiting feedback from service for date to complete check

• Neighbourhood Night Nursing Service – 6 months overdue; changed base in September 2024; awaiting feedback from service for date to complete check

• Cardiac Team – 3 months overdue; will be completed by end of Q2

• Children’s Community Nursing – 2 months overdue; will be completed by end of July 2025

• 6 x CYPMHS locations – 1 month overdue; agreed to delay checks until Q2 pending outcome of Quality & Value programme and review of team bases/merger of teams completed 

• Infection Prevention & Control team – 1 month overdue; agreed to move check to September 2025 in line with start of annual staff influenza vaccination campaign as this is the only medicine the service handles

• Yeadon Neighbourhood Team - 1 month overdue; awaiting feedback from service for date to complete check 

• 0-19 PHINs – 1 month overdue; will be completed by end of July 2025

• 8 x Podiatry Service locations – 1 month overdue; all checks will be completed by end of July 2025

In Q1 2025/26 the Medicines Optimisation Team reviewed the list of services who are required to undertake a Medicines Code Assurance Check every two years and identified three teams \(Falls Service, Tier 3 Weight Management and Nutrition and Dietetics\) who had previously indicated that a check was not required, but the service offer had changed, and medicines related activities were being delivered. They are now included in the dataset for reporting. Support will be provided by the Medicines Optimisation Team as required. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

An improved position will be seen in the September 2025 dataset. 

15





Caring

**By caring, we mean staff involving and treating people with **

**compassion, kindness, dignity, and respect**

Summary

The organisation aims to uphold a strong commitment to caring by ensuring staff engage with individuals compassionately and respectfully. Staff are expected to treat people with kindness, uphold their dignity, and involve them in decisions about their care. While there are examples of positive interactions and a culture that values empathy, there are also areas of concern. 

Recent Friends and Family Test \(FFT\) results indicate that a lower-than-expected percentage of patients and service users would recommend the service and although we are above average, we have only met our target twice in the reporting period. We are reviewing this on a regular basis, and we are committed to ensuring quality of care is not impacted. The Patient Experience team are currently leading a piece of work around PSHO standards to ensure robust application into the organisation, this will result in more timely, appropriate and proportionate responses to patient feedback. 

Indicator Updates

This section gives updates on specific indicators that meet criteria in the Caring Domain. 

**% of Respondents reporting a “Very Good” or “Good” experience in Community **

**Care \(FFT\) **

16



**What is the trend that we see? **

The data shows to be stable and consistent from last year to date. Data has remained within the upper and lower control limits, with no special cause variation. 

**What is being done about it? **

We have recently recruited to the Patient Engagement Manager, and Engagement Officer posts. Both are currently in the early stages of their induction. As part of their induction both have received training and support from Civica \(FFT platform\). 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

Once they are through the induction phase, they will be able to understand the system and monitor trends more effectively and feedback further on the trend.

Effective

**By effective, we mean that care, treatment, and support **

**received by people achieve good outcomes and helps **

**people maintain quality of life and is based on the best **

**available evidence. **

Summary

Clinical audit

Engagement with the clinical audit program has reduced, with work underway to understand whether this is reduction in compliance and completion of audits within services or lack of capacity to send the required returns to the Audit & effectiveness manager in order to complete the data submission. Quality Committee have the Clinical Audit Overview for 24.25 on the agenda for July 25 

and work is underway to review both the Trust annual audit plan approach and the effectiveness measures for clinical audit compliance. 

National audit

Although this is reported as cause for no concern there are currently 8 national audits relevant to LCHT \(shown in table below\). We are registered for all audits but cannot submit data to 3 of them, which are the National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation \(NACR\), Sentinel Stroke Audit Programme \(SNAPP\) and National Obesity Audit. More detail is included below and in the paper to Quality Committee. 

NICE 

There are 19 open guidance currently in the organisation with assessment pending or action plans in place. 

Two Guidance are currently out of the two-year timescale to implementation set out in the PL326 

Policy for the Dissemination, Implementation and Monitoring of NICE Guidance. One guidance has become overdue during this reporting period. One guidance will potentially become overdue in the next reporting period. One overdue guidance has been closed. These are:

• NG197 Shared Decision Making

• NG212 Mental Wellbeing at Work

• NG236 Stroke rehabilitation in adults \(becomes overdue in quarter 3\). 

All guidance has been risk assessed as low or minor risk. 

Seven guidance was proactively reopened in 2024-2025 to check for compliance against service redesign and developments. 

18





**Audit & Effectiveness**

19



**What is the trend that we see? **

**Local Audits**

97 audits have been registered to date for the 2025-26 Annual Audit Plan. As services add audits to the Annual Audit Plan throughout the year, the total number of audits registered increases, which will affect the data reported each quarter. 



At the end of Q1, the Clinical Effectiveness Team is still receiving updates for audit status throughout services, however, 6 audits have already been completed. 

**National Audits: **

There are 8 national audits relevant to LCHT, and we are currently registered for all of them. 

Data submission for 2 audits \(NACR and SSNAP\), has been limited due to changes in data set requirements and resulting issues with data collection and reporting. We cannot submit data to the National Obesity Audit as this has only recently been identified as relevant to LCHT, with data requirements still under review. Support from Clinical Systems and Business Intelligence is likely to be needed.

20



**What is being done about it? **

A new annual audit plan \(AAP\) has been launched for 2025-26 to improve reporting to Clinical Effectiveness Team \(CET\) and work is underway to transform the approach and alignment of this for 26.27. 

Drop-in sessions will be delivered quarterly to help improve submission of audit information to the CET. 

Development of a new registration and progress template with a move to automation to support information and learning being shared. 

Monthly reviews of national audit activity via MS Forms, led by the Clinical Effectiveness and Compliance Manager. 

Annual audit of the Audit Policy to ensure ongoing relevance and effectiveness. 

National audit \(NCAPOP\)

Monthly review of National Audits by Clinical Effectiveness and Compliance Manager including updates from services via the Business Unit Clinical Lead now in place. 

CET review national audits monthly and send any that are potentially relevant to appropriate services for review. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

We expect to see some improvement in Q2 in registration and updates sent to the CET. Further improvement will not be seen until the latter part of the year when services plan to complete audits in Q3 and Q4 and the new registration and progress template is completed. 

There is already an improvement in reporting on and engagement with national audits. Submission of data to the 3 

national audits outstanding is dependent on capacity within Business Intelligence and Clinical Systems to support ongoing work required. 

21





**NICE**

**What is the trend that we see? **

Two Guidance are currently out of the two-year timescale to implementation set out in the PL326 Policy for the Dissemination, Implementation and Monitoring of NICE Guidance. One guidance has become overdue during this reporting period. One guidance will potentially become overdue in the next reporting period. One overdue guidance has been closed. 

**What is being done about it? **

All guidance has been risk assessed as low or minor risk. Actions to achieve full concordance with NICE guidance have been escalated to Business Unit Clinical and Quality Leads. 

Seven guidance was reopened in 2024-2025 to check for compliance against service redesign and developments. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

The number of open NICE Guidance fluctuates depending on new guidance issued. There is an improvement in overdue NICE guidance, as 1 has been closed, with a further 1 pending closure. 

22





**Equity**

**What is the trend that we see? **

People from IMD 1 are waiting longer for services in consultant led and non-consultant led lists. 

We can see that the difference in waiting times between IMD 1 \(most deprived\) and IMD 2-10 has continued to grow. In consultant led waits, patients in the most deprived areas have gone from waiting the same or less time, to significantly longer since March 2025. In non-consultant led waits, patients from the most deprived areas are seeing progressively longer waits, a pattern that has been generally worsening since June 2024. 

This pattern was also noted in evaluation of the Access LCH initiative to reduce waiting list sizes, namely that there had been an 8% reduction in IMD2-10, but 5% in IMD1. Subsequent analysis has identified that this is due to higher rates of cancellation and non-attendance by people in IMD1 

rather than a difference in rates of invitations to appointments. Cancellation and non-attendance can be for a variety of different reasons, but those living in areas of deprivation can face multiple barriers such as access to transport, financial challenges, caring responsibilities, managing multiple medical appointments and insecure employment making it more likely they won’t attend appointments. 

Waiting impacts patients differently. Evidence shows that those in IMD 1 often seek help at a later stage in their health condition, meaning they often enter the waiting list in a poorer state of health. 

This can lead to more rapid deterioration in health whilst waiting for care and poorer health outcomes. People living in IMD 1 are also at higher risk from adverse outcomes from long waits due to social disadvantage such as loss of income or employment whilst waiting for medical treatment. 

23



**What is being done about it? **

Work to contact patients who missed appointments was started during the Access LCH initiative, with targeted signposting and adjustments put in place dependent on the cause of the missed appointment. Work is ongoing to identify how this can be continued and opportunities being identified for proactive support to patients at greatest risk of missing appointments. A new resource on the Information Hub is being developed to signpost patients to sources of support to attend appointments. 

A review of the Access policy, incorporating missed appointments and discharges is underway, to bring it in line with the new national  elective access policy, NHSE principles for good 

communication with patients waiting for care, and embed consistency in equitable approaches to managing missed appointments. Embedding the revised Accessible Information Standards is also expected to support a reduction in missed appointments. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

Completion of the Access policy is due in Quarter 2 and implementation of a new ‘About Me’ 

template incorporating communication needs and wider reasonable adjustments is due to start in Quarter 3. A working group has been started to consider the resource requirements needed to continue the telephone call support to patients at greatest risk of missing appointments and therefore timescale for this to continue.

Responsive

**By responsive, we mean services are tailored to meet the **

**needs of individual people and are delivered in a way to **

**ensure flexibility, choice, and continuity of care**

Summary

Although patients continue to wait long times to access treatment in some of our services, further improvements have been made during this period. These include within Podiatry, Children’s Occupational Therapy and Cardiac Services. 

The total number of people waiting for care to start has stabilised, with a total of 27,732 people waiting for care to start at the end of June 2025, compared to 30,154 at the start of the calendar year. The total number of patients waiting more than 52 weeks continues to decrease, apart from Neurodevelopmental Assessment Services, falling to 3,828 at the end of June 2025, from 4,139 at the end of April. 

Our Children’s Audiology Service met the target for 99% of patients seen within 6-weeks, achieving 100% in April 2024. 

Key areas of risk are highlighted in this report, including services with the greatest concerns relating to 52-week waiting times. 

25





Indicator Updates

This section gives updates on specific indicators that meet criteria in the Responsive Domain. 

**RTT \(Referral to Treatment\) Waiting Time Standards**

**What is the trend that we see? **

The long term declines we have seen in Performance have begun to hold steady in the percentage of patients waiting less than 18 weeks, at 24.8% in June 2025, however the number of people waiting more than 52 weeks continues to grow, with 1,279 patients waiting more than a year on an RTT pathway. 

Now that Community Gynaecology is no longer classified as an RTT service, these indicators only include our Community Paediatric pathways and clinics within the Children’s ICAN Service. PND continues to be the primary influence, where high demand for pre-school neurodevelopmental \(autism\) diagnosis continues. At the end of June 2025, there were 2,505 people waiting on a consultant-led RTT pathway, and 2,160 of these \(86%\) were waiting for a PND appointment. 

26



**What is being done about it? **

For ICAN Clinics, the primary driver of the demand continues to be for Paediatric Neuro-Developmental \(PND\) assessments in under 5s. The service is currently in the process of piloting a needs-led offer, to run alongside the assessment and diagnosis pathway. This will provide first-line support to all families that are referred, regardless of whether they meet the criteria for diagnosis. This will be implemented alongside changes to the referral acceptance criteria for the service, which could lead to approximately 50% reductions in the number of children being offered a full assessment. 

The pathway for diagnosis is also being redesigned to focus on assessments being conducted and led by Paediatricians, supported by effective information gathering from other disciplines and leveraging capacity in other CBU services. The proposed pathways have been modelled to help understand the capacity required to meet current and future demand, and this will be used to inform a business case requesting permanent ICB investment in the new model. 

Locum Paediatricians continue to offer diagnostic assessments. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

Current plans to implement the change in referral criteria are due to be implemented by Q3 this year, which should lead to some reductions in the waiting times, but modelling suggests that this would still take more than 3 years to reduce the current waiting list without additional investment alongside. 

27





**% of patients waiting under 18 weeks \(non reportable\)**

**What is the trend that we see? **

A long-term trend of statistically significant improvement is now visible, showing that services have been making sustained improvements since January 2025. Performance against the 18-week standard, however, remains significantly below the target of 95%. These performance improvements coincide with the additional scrutiny and focus given to waiting list performance through the Access LCH governance structures. 

There are several areas of good improvement and recovery for some services, including:

• Podiatry have achieved a 14% reduction in their total waiting list size in the last 3 months, specifically reducing the number of people waiting more than 40 weeks from 712 at the end of April, to 322 at the end of June

• The Cardiac Service have reduced the number of people waiting by 17% in last 3 months

• Tier 3 Weight Management Service has now reopened to new referrals, and is managing waiting times effectively with validations and appointments focussed on those who have waited longest

• Our CAMHS Services have achieved overall waiting list reductions of 44% in last 12 months, but increases in waiting times overall are heavily influenced by the waiting times at Mind Mate SPA and the long waiting times for Autism and ADHD assessments. 

28



**52-Week Waiting Times**

The total number of patients now waiting more than 52 weeks \(including RTT and non-RTT pathways\) has reduced throughout the quarter, falling to 3,828 at the end of June 2025 from 4,640 at the end of March 2025. At the time of writing, 51% \(1,957 out of 3,828\) of these were children awaiting ND 

assessments in both our Pre-School and School Age assessment teams. A further 28% of these patients are waiting for our Community Dental Service. 

At the time of writing, the services with patients waiting more than a year are: Service

29



**What is being done about it? **

This update focuses on updates in neurodevelopmental assessment services, Podiatry, Community Dental and Adult Speech and Swallowing Service. 

**CAMHS**

The service continues to develop a Business Case to understand what long-term investment is required to rebalance capacity with demand, both for ND Assessments and for the Medication Clinics. The Medication Team has successfully recruited to further Nurse Medical Prescriber roles, and the increased capacity should lead to some reductions or waiting times throughout the year

**Dental**

Waiting Times for Community Dental remain a national and regional problem, and these challenges are replicated in LCH. However, our service is beginning to show positive improvements in waiting times for patients, with the total number of people waiting falling to 2,659 by the end of June 2025, from 2,914 at the end of March 2025. The total number of people waiting more than 52 weeks fell to 1,076 from 1,382 

over the same period. 

The service continues with recruitment, but longer-term risks remain to our ability to reduce the number of people waiting, and to ensure that patients aren’t waiting excessively. The service is currently developing plans to utilise targeted non recurrent monies received through the new WY CDS contract from 1st April to reduce waiting lists over a three- year period. This will need to be delivered being mindful of maintaining balance in reducing waiting times for routine assessment against delivery of targets to deliver full courses of treatment. 

**Adult SLT**

A long-term gap is evident between capacity and demand, driven particularly by increases in the number of urgent and complex referrals coming from acute wards. As a result, the service has limited remaining capacity to see routine patients, and waiting times are continuing to grow. The service also has long standing capacity gaps due to long term sickness. The service is scoping options for a future service model to inform a business case. 

Significant work has been completed to date as part of Quality and Value to define a new offer of clinic treatment pathways, and implementation work continues. 

The service currently has 858 people waiting, which has reduced from 986 in January 2025. A total of 169 

people have waited more than 52 weeks, which has increased from 113 in April 2025. It is expected that these numbers will continue to grow. 

**Children’s SLT**

These patients are waiting for Parent Training Classes. There is only a limited number of these offered per year, and these patients have missed several previous opportunities leading to long waiting times. 

Parents are being offered a further chance to accept the offer of training if still required. 

**MSK**

All patients waiting more than 40 weeks have been reviewed and are classified as “out-of-woodwork” patients. 

These are patients that were referred using the Choose and Book System but didn’t take up the offer of care at the time, but then subsequently decide to request support using the original referral. All these patients have appointments booked in. 

30





**CUCS**

Longer term problems exist for the service with sickness rates and capacity to see bladder and bowel patients. 

The service is currently working with MSK to consider joint clinics for some patients. 

**ICAN Medical Clinics \(Growth and Nutrition and Community Paediatrics\)**

This service shares clinical capacity with the other ICAN Clinics such as PND and Child Protection Medical, which limits the availability of clinical time. The service is arranging appointments between geographical hubs where possible. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

We expect to see continued improvement through the rest of the financial year, but it is unlikely that the Trust will meet the target in this time frame. 

**Percentage of patients waiting less than 6 weeks for a diagnostic test**

**\(DM01\)**

**What is the trend that we see? **

Performance continues at stable levels above the target

**What is being done about it? **

No further action required

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

Updates will be provided if performance deteriorates from the current position. 

31





**CAMHS Eating Disorder Waiting Time Standards**



**What is the trend that we see? **

Performance against both the urgent and routine targets continues to be below target, and this is being driven by demand that outstrips capacity. The service has a number of gaps in roles that are sufficiently qualified to offer initial assessment appointments. 

The service has also seen a dramatic increase in the complexity of patients over the last 4 years. In 2022, patients would an average of 8 appointments from referral to discharge, but this has now increased to 18 per patient. Patients are also staying longer on the caseload and requiring a higher frequency of contact to manage their risk and provide effective treatment. 

**What is being done about it? **

The ICB has recently provided additional funding to increase capacity for assessment appointments. 

Increasing the availability of the more skilled clinicians in the team will support both the capacity for assessing new patients, and the capability of the service to manage the increased risk and complexity of patients. 

The service is also working with the Performance Team to assess the weekly number of assessment and treatment slots that are required to meet weekly referral demand patterns. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

The service aims to have filled posts by Q4 this year, but improvements may be visible sooner if changes to the weekly assessment slot structure can be staffed from existing capacity. 

32





**LMWS**



**What is the trend that we see? **

Performance against this measure continues to hover close to the lower control limit, suggesting a statistically significant deterioration, but performance in June began a potential return towards average levels. However, performance is still some way below the levels achieved in 2023/24. 

**What is being done about it? **

The service has reported capacity pressures in consistently achieving this target but has begun to allocate dedicated staff to offer screening appointments each week. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

Some improvements are already visible, and these patterns will be monitored going forwards. 

33





**Neighbourhood Teams**

34



**What is the trend that we see? **

A statistically significant pattern of high levels of referrals has now emerged, with 8 consecutive months of higher-than-average volumes. The number of contacts completed by the teams have also shown early signs of increasing, reaching similar levels to those achieved in 2023/24. Productivity remains at average levels. 

**What is being done about it? **

There are several pieces of ongoing work that we expect to generate a reduction in demand for NTs – 

this includes the triage improvement plan and streamlining processes which will reduce unwarranted referrals. Self-referrals have been introduced for our Neighbourhood Clinics which will direct referrals directly to clinics instead of via the NTs. We are also undertaking significant work in the Q&V service redesign on our criteria and offer across both nursing and therapy which has and will be shared with system partners. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

Unfortunately, we are not in full control of the referrals we receive \(which is impacted by many factors\) however by Q3 we expect to see an increase in the number of rejected referrals due to not meeting criteria as part of the work outlined above – this will help inform further guidance and comms to system providers to reduce unwarranted referrals in Q4 and ensure patients are directed to the right place. 

There are also various pieces of work in train which will allow for better granularity of data so we can drill down into the demand for specific sub-teams/functions rather than just NTs as a whole – we expect this improved data to be available from Q3 onwards.

Well-Led

**By well-led, we mean leadership, management and **

**governance of the organisation assures the delivery of **

**high-quality person-centred care, supports learning and **

**innovation, and promotes an open and fair culture**

Summary

Sickness absence levels have** **improved to below the target level, following a recent period of high sickness. 

Focused support continues for “hot spot” areas, and we can expect further scrutiny around sickness absence, as one of the workforce metrics within the National Oversight Framework. 

The deteriorating position with the overall percentage of staff who have identified as BME \(including exec. 

Board\), was found to be due to a non-mandatory field within the new recruitment system. This enabled candidates to by-pass this declaration route. This has now been resolved, and we expect to see improvements over the next 3 months

Turnover has been flagged within the summary table of the main report as Deteriorating/Passing, however, an increase in this metric is not a concern, in line with organisational context. 

Statutory and Mandatory Training continues to hover just below 90% target. 

Appraisal compliance continues to fluctuate but remains above higher limits/threshold. 

36





Indicator Updates

This section gives updates on specific indicators that meet criteria in the Well-Led Domain. 

**Total sickness absence rate \(Monthly\) \(%\)**



**What is the trend that we see? **

Performance has improved to below the target level but remains inconsistent as the target continues to sit within the control limits. This highlights that performance could see further failures of the target without being the result of any process change. However, performance within the reporting period sits at good level below the target, following a recent period of high sickness. 

**What is being done about it? **

The People Directorate continue to work with managers and provide additional support where “hot spot” 

areas are identified. Recent focused work within the Adult Business Unit in supporting managers with absence management has led to a reduction in sickness within the Adults Night Service from, 21.4% to 11%. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

One of the delivery metrics contained within the National Oversight Framework, due out in the coming months, is around sickness absence rate. We therefore expect to see more focus on this with operations and people partnering input. 

In the meantime, sickness absence continues to fluctuate often due to seasonal variations, which is closely monitored and corrective interventions taken as appropriate. Supporting staff's health and wellbeing remains a Trust priority, and we regularly promote a wide range of health and wellbeing support staff can access, to help keep them well and in work. 

37





**Staff Turnover**



**What is the trend that we see? **

Whilst there have been two months of higher than usual turnover, with both March and April appearing above the upper control limit, this is not a cause for concern. 

**What is being done about it? **

A slight increase in turnover rates is not a cause for concern, as it continues to be within limits and in line with external benchmarking data. Turnover will continue to be monitored in line with organisational context. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

This is not a cause for concern – if we see a spike in turnover within a particular staff group or service area, this would be explored in more detail. 

38





**The overall percentage of staff who have identified as BME \(including exec. board** **members\) **



**What is the trend that we see? **

A statistically significant change is now occurring, with 5 consecutive months of decline in a row leading to deteriorating performance. 

**What is being done about it? **

Following an investigation the People Operations and Recruitment team identified that new candidates could bypass the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion \(EDI\) questions in the Applicant Tracking System \(ATS\) because the fields were not mandatory. We have now resolved this issue with the software provider. 

From August, all new applicants will be required to complete the EDI questions. They will still have the option to select "Prefer not to say," but they will no longer be able to skip the section entirely. 

We will also send targeted emails to previous candidates, asking them to update their EDI information in the Electronic Staff Record \(ESR\) system. 

These actions will help us collect more complete and accurate EDI data. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

We expect to see improvement over the next 3 months. 

39





**‘RIDDOR’ incidents reported to Health and Safety Executive**

**What is the trend that we see? **

Two RIDDOR incidents have been reported. A staff back injury due to leg bandaging and a patient fall at a health centre and sustained a head injury 

**What is being done about it? **

The investigation into the staff back injury is ongoing. 

Investigation into the patient fall incident identified additional warning signs were needed. 

**When do we expect to see improvement? **

The staff back injury investigation is ongoing. 

The warning signage was implemented immediately after the incident.

Finance

**Summary**

**Income & Expenditure**

As at the end of July 2025, the Trust reported a year-to-date \(YTD\) surplus of £0.1m, which is £0.1m favourable to its break-even plan. The Trust is on track to deliver its full-year break-even position. Progress on the Quality & Value Programme has secured £3.5m in recurrent savings to date. These results have been formally submitted to the West Yorkshire Integrated Care Board \(WYICB\) and NHS England. 

**Cash**

The Trust's cash position remains strong, with a year-to-date closing balance of £43.9m, but lower than the planned figure by £3.6m. This variance is mainly due to an increase in receivables and is expected to be a timing issue only. The cash operating days, that is to pay short-term liabilities, is 70 days. 

**Capital Expenditure**

The Trust’s capital plan for 2025/26 is £9.7m, of which £3.4m is in respect of operational capital expenditure and the balance is to fund Right of Use Asset \(RoU\) leases following the adoption of IFRS 16. At the end of July 2025, the Trust has reported a spend of £0.58m on owned assets and £1.94m on ROU assets. The underspend against plan as at Month 4 is related to lower than planned lease remeasurements \(£0.6m\) and finalisation of two property leases \(£2.5m\). These are partly offset by the operational capital plan being phased to the end of the year, resulting in a £0.4m year-to-date overspend which will be recovered during the year. 

**Quality & Value Programme**

By the end of July, the Trust had identified £10.1m of its £14m recurrent savings target for 2025/26. This represents an increase of £0.4m compared with the £9.7m reported in June. The remaining £3.9m will be 41



delivered through non-recurrent measures enabled by strengthened grip and control. 

These non-recurrent elements are assessed as low risk, with active work underway to transition them into sustainable, recurrent savings via the Quality & Value \(Q&V\) Programme. The Trust continues to forecast full in-year delivery of the £14m target. Of the £10.1m recurrent plans identified, £9.8m is fully developed and in delivery, with £3.4m delivered YTD. 

**Temporary Staffing**

As of July, the Trust is employing fewer temporary staff than originally planned. Further reductions are expected as the transformation programme advances, supported by the introduction of more sustainable staffing models such as the new Forensic Medical Examiners model within Police Custody and the "fair day’s work" approach within CBU.

Appendix II – High level Indicator Development

Overview

This report gives a summary of the progress to-date and upcoming planned work to improve and develop the assurance given to the Board and Committees through the Performance Brief. 

In 2024, plans were developed to use Statistical Process Control \(SPC\) methodologies as the analytical foundation for the Performance Brief, and eventually as the foundation for all Performance monitoring and management across the Trust. 

High Level Indicator Development 

Each year, the Board and Committees specify the High-Level Indicators \(HLIs\) to be selected for the Performance Brief to give assurance on key strategic and operational priorities. The table below gives a summary of the work underway to migrate to SPC approaches.

➢

**1 Introduction**

The role of Guardian of Safe Working Hours \(GSWH\) was introduced as part of the 

2016 Resident Doctor’s contract. The role of the GSWH is to independently assure the confidence of Resident doctors that their concerns will be addressed and require improvements in working hours and rotas. 

Purpose of Guardian of Safe Working Hours report 

To provide assurance that doctors and dentists in training within LCH NHS Trust are safely rostered and that their working hours are consistent with the Resident 

Doctors Contract 2016 Terms & Conditions of Service \(TCS\). 

To report on any identified issues affecting trainee doctors and dentists in Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, including morale, training and working hours. 

➢

**2 Current position/main body of the report**

There are 16 Resident Doctors employed throughout the Trust currently \(in different specialities, both full time and less than full time training\) as detailed in the table below. This includes Resident doctors employed directly by LCH and on honorary

**Rota gaps and CAMHS ST rota **

The CAMHS ST non resident on call rota consists of a 1:5 rota, and gaps \(currently 3 gaps\) on this rota are covered by locums, typically doctors who have worked on the rota in the past or doctors currently working for LCH who are willing to do extra shifts. The current CAMHS ST on call rota is checked by senior CAMHS admin staff with experience in managing CAMHS consultant rota to double check the Locum 

shifts picked up by Resident doctors.

• **Risk and assurance**

**Feedback from Resident doctors**

Resident Doctors Forum \(RDF\) was held on MS teams on 03/07/2025. 

It was agreed to review and monitor CAMHS non-resident on call rota. Attendance 

was poor due to unavoidable issues for most resident doctors. In view of poor 

attendance and the need to review and incorporate changes as a part of the new 

exception reporting reforms, GSWH and people present in the meeting agreed to 

arrange an extraordinary RDF prior to the next meeting in Oct. This meeting is 

scheduled for 02/09/2025. 

**CAMHS Historic ST rota issue**

The first grievance received by the Trust in relation to this issue has been 

investigated and concluded with areas for improvement noted, but no allegations 

upheld against the Trust. 

A second grievance has also been received in relation to this matter and is currently being reviewed. 

**Exception reporting reforms **

The BMA resident doctors committee \(UKRDC\) has secured an agreement on 

exception reporting reform in April 2025, as agreed as a part of the 2024 pay deal. 

There will be significant changes as agreed under the new framework that are 

related to – exception reporting software system, onboarding of resident doctors on to the reporting system, processing of exception reports, all educational exception reports to be sent to DME and changes to the time period in which exception report is filed. 

Page 4 of 5

GSWH has requested People operation team to work on the reforms and will be linking in with the team along with head of medical education, DME, DMD and BMA 

IRO to review the next steps of implementation. 

Since the last Trust Board meeting, LCH people’s directorate has produced a new 

ER forms that will be implemented from September 2025. GSWH has reviewed and 

requested the form to be circulated to all Resident doctors for feedback and to be discussed at the Extraordinary meeting due on 02/09/25. 

➢

**4 Next steps**

GSWH will continue to work with Key people to implement exception reporting 

reforms. 

➢

**5 Recommendations**

The Board is recommended to:

• Support GSWH with the work in relation to implementation of changes for exception reporting system/pathway.

**ANNUAL REPORT ON SAFE WORKING HOURS: **

**DOCTORS AND DENTISTS IN TRAINING**

**1. Executive summary**

This report covers the period from May 2024 to May 2025. 

Grievance case has been filed by doctors who worked as resident doctors during 

the period of 2018-2021 at LCH. CAMHS historic rota issue that was investigated 

in depth over the last few years was concluded and affected resident doctors were informed about their rights to file a grievance case if they needed to look into the issue further. The case is on going and GSWH and BMA IRO have offered LCH and affected Resident doctors the support they need. 

The BMA resident doctors committee \(UKRDC\) has secured an agreement on exception reporting reform in April 2025, as agreed as a part of the 2024 pay deal. There will be significant changes as agreed under the new framework that 

are related to – exception reporting software system, onboarding of resident doctors on to the reporting system, processing of exception reports, all educational exception reports to be sent to DME and changes to the time period 

in which exception report is filed. GSWH is working with People’s directorate team to implement the changes at the earliest. 

Specialist training for Resident doctors in Community paediatric has been impacted by the number of on call shifts. This is an ongoing issue and GSWH 

continues to work with Paediatric college tutor to address the issue across both LCH and Leeds teaching hospital Trust where the on call work is performed. 

**2. Introduction** 

This report, as required by the Resident Doctor’s contract, is intended to provide the Board with an evidenced based report on the working hours and practices of 

Resident Doctors within the Trust, confirming safe working practices and will illustrate areas for concern. This report is written with the information available relating to data to date in the period covered. 

Purpose: to report on issues affecting trainee doctors and dentists such as working hours and the accessibility of training which forms part of the rotational training programme.

**5. Exception Reporting **

No exception reports have been filed over the last year Q1-Q4 24.25. 

5.1 **Working Hours and work schedule review**

Page **4** of **6**

For CAMHS non-resident on-call , a compliant rota is in place. Work schedule has been drawn up based on the work conducted during on call and 

incorporating the required rest periods and breaks as per the Resident doctors contract. 

GSWH has requested HRBS the need for a robust monitoring system with 

every cohort of resident doctors who join the trust. 

5.2 **Educational Opportunities **

No exception reports submitted relating to educational opportunities. 

Resident doctors in community paediatrics cover on-call work at Leeds 

Children's Hospital as a part of their job. Sub-speciality training \(Nationally approved training post with specific requirements for specialist training\) are concerned that they are not receiving the required training due to not having 

enough training time as recommended by the Royal college guidelines. The 

guidance recommends that the Resident doctor spends 70% of their time in 

base speciality and the rest to cover on-call work. This is currently not fully achieved in community paediatrics. 

The issue is a long standing issue and progress has been made over the last 

year with few small changes that have positively impacted on the training time resident doctors receive. 

GSWH continues to work with paediatric college tutor, GSWH from LTHT 

Trust and rota co-ordinators from LTHT to ensure that the training needs are 

optimised. 

**6.0** **Rota Gaps**

The CAMHS ST non resident on call rota consists of a 1:5 rota, and gaps on 

this rota are covered by locums, typically doctors who have worked on the 

rota in the past or doctors currently working for LCH who are willing to do 

extra shifts. The current CAMHS ST on call rota is checked by senior CAMHS 

admin staff with experience in managing CAMHS consultant rota to double 

check the Locum shifts picked up by Resident doctors. 

**6.1 CAMHS Historic ST rota issue**

*Disclaimer: Section 6.1 contains information that is historic and complex. It* *contains overview of the issue but not the nuances. GSWH will be able to* *guide the board with the nuances and any further updates at the meeting*

Issue with compliance of CAMHS non-resident on-call rota was raised as a concern by a resident doctor in April 2021. The issue affects resident doctors 

on the CAMHS non-resident on-call rota employed by the Trust from the year 

2016/2017 until 2021. This issue has now reached conclusion that has been 

put forward to affected Junior doctors. 

Page **5** of **6**

One Junior doctor has raised a grievance case on 23/11/24 via correspondence to Director of workforce. There has not been any further update since the last Trust board meeting. The case is on-going. 

**7. Engagement with Resident doctors and Resident doctor forum meetings **

The Virtual Resident Doctor’s Forum \(JDF\) was held in July 2024, October 

2024, January 2025 and April 2025. 

Resident doctors have found the JDF platform a useful platform to voice their 

feedback around HR issues, training opportunities. Attendance continues to be 

an issue despite the virtual nature of the meeting. Ideas and suggestions have 

been included to improve engagement with resident doctors. 

**8 Fines**



No fines have been levied by the GSWH over the past year. 

**9 Recommendations**

**Board is recommended to:**

• Receive this assurance regarding Resident Doctor working patterns and 

conditions within the Trust. 

• To note that there is a grievance case ongoing that is raised by Resident doctors affected by CAMHS historic rota issue. 

• Support GSWH with the work in relation to implementation of Exception reporting reforms and changes to Resident doctors contract changes. 

• Support GSWH with the work in relation to improving community paediatric training and educational opportunities.

**1 Introduction**

The report details key areas of progress and further identified work against each of the four key principles identified in the GMC document of 2024 as those that 

underpin effective clinical governance in this context. These are:

• **Principle 1: An effective environment**

Organisations create an environment which delivers effective clinical 

governance for doctors. 

• **Principle 2: Continuous Improvement**

Clinical governance processes for doctors are managed and monitored with a 

view to continuous improvement. 

• **Principle 3: Fairness**

Safeguards are in place to ensure clinical governance arrangements for 

doctors are fair and free from bias and discrimination. 

• **Principle 4: Supporting Process**

Organisations deliver clinical governance processes required to support

medical revalidation and the evaluation of doctors’ fitness to practice. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust is a Designated Body responsible for the 

appraisals of all doctors employed by the Trust. Regulations require that all 

Designated Bodies must nominate or appoint a Responsible Officer, who must be a 

licensed doctor. This post is held in LCH by the Executive Medical Director and is therefore represented on the Board. 

The Responsible Officer is supported by a Deputy Medical Director \(Professional 

Standards\) and a Head of Medical Education and Revalidation. The Deputy Medical 

Director post has been held by an individual holding consultant status since Sept 2019. This individual has undergone NHSE approved Responsible Officer training. 

This report covers the period of 01/04/24 - 31/03/25. During this period LCH had a prescribed connection with 39 doctors, and responsibilities to 8 dentists who 

undergo annual appraisal but whose regulatory body the General Dental Council 

\(GDC\) does not have a revalidation process. 

Of the 39 doctors that were due an appraisal, 100% \(39 doctors\) completed their 

appraisal within 24/25. 8 dentists were due an annual appraisal for 24/25 of which 100% were completed. 7 doctors were due for revalidation in 24/25, 100% of which were successfully revalidated for five years. 

LCH had one doctor in a remediation or MHPS process during 24/25. The Trust 

Board have been regularly updated in private session.

Compared to the previous year there is an increase in the percentage of staff 

recording their ethnic group as ‘White’ \(21 in 23/24\), and a decrease in staff 

recording their ethnic group as ‘Ethnic Minority \(17 in 23/24\). This is in part due to the rotations of resident doctors. Staff recording their ethic group as

‘Unspecified/Not Stated’ has decreased from last year \(31 in 23/24\), the total 

number of staff recorded has remained the same as the previous year.

**Total**

The number of staff recorded as 26-30 has reduced due to changes in resident 

doctors rotating in and out of the Trust. The analysis of the workforce based on ethnicity demonstrates a highly diverse workforce. 

**Medical Job Planning**

In May this year NHSE renewed their focus on the importance of job planning for the medical workforce as a means to effectively deliver clinical services – increasing productivity and delivering efficiency gains as well as supporting staff in a fair and consistent fashion. The Trust has job plans well established in the medical 

workforce however we do not currently use job planning software which would 

enable better understanding of workforce capacity. 

The ‘Levels of Attainment’ are benchmarks used to measure a trust’s progress in

adopting and using e-job planning software. They are:

•

Level 0: No e-job planning

•

Level 1: Basic individual e-job planning

•

Level 2: Advanced individual e-job planning

Page 4 of 9

•

Level 3: Team e-job planning

•

Level 4: Organisational e-job planning

Currently LCH is scoping the procurement of e-job planning software and will need funding and resource to be able to implement the system and deliver the benefits. 

Therefore, the Trust will report a level 0 level of attainment to NHS England. 

**Temporary Staffing**

Over the last year the following services have been supported by temporary bank 

staff:

**CLASS Data 24/25**

**Total Hours worked **

**Service Worked for**

**\(previous years hours\)**

**Community CYPMHS**

**1044 **\(2306\)

**ICAN Service**

**192 **\(0\)

**Community Gynaecology Service**

**239.35 **\(147\)

**Total Hours**

**1487.35 \(3,283\)**

The significant decrease in utilisation of temporary staff in the CYPMHS service reflects a larger number of staff on the rota due to successful National recruitment resulting in fewer gaps. 

In the ICAN service following the retirement and return of a SAS doctor to LCH Bank for ad-hoc sessions, ICAN were able to increase capacity by delivering additional Initial Health Needs Assessment \(iHNA\) clinics and seeing expedited Paediatric 

Neuro Disability Clinic patients. Previously, without paediatricians on Bank, the service relied solely on locums, so this has provided a more flexible staffing solution. 

The increase in Community Gynaecology was the result of work to decrease the 

waiting list in the service. 

Leeds Sexual Health Service had previously employed a number of doctors via 

CLASS to support clinical activity, these doctors have subsequently been offered contracts of employment, so their hours are no longer logged through Bank. 

**Education**

In the year 24/25 Leeds Community Healthcare was able to offer the following 

educational placements:

\*Undergraduate placements are calculated based on 6 cohorts per academic year, multiplied by number of students per cohort, multiplied by days to give a representation of ‘placements’ provided, the same students may have been at LCH in different services during different cohorts. 

\*\*Postgraduate – The Trust has 22 formal training posts, but headcount can fluctuate due to LTFT trainees job sharing posts. 

ICAN and CYPMHS/Psychiatry postgraduate figures fluctuated from previous years 

due to LTFT trainees job sharing posts rotating in and out of the Trust. LSH has increased by two due to two trainees returning from Maternity Leave. 

LCH provides clinical placements for Postgraduate and Undergraduate Medical 

Education working in partnership with NHS England and the University of Leeds, to oversee clinical training for all levels of medical students and doctors in training. 

The Trust has a medical education governance structure, led by the Medical 

Director, and supported by the Associate Director for Teaching and Student Support \(ADTSS\) for undergraduates and Director Medical Education \(DME\) for 

postgraduates, clinical staff, trainers and a dedicated administration team focussed on delivering and supporting high quality education and training. 

LCH hosts over 400 Undergraduate Medical Students with over 900 placement 

opportunities, 2 Foundation Year, and 22 Postgraduate training posts across 7 

different services per year. Community placements provide experience of delivering care in a wide range of settings including in people’s own homes as well as in 

clinics, Community Centres and schools. 

The Trust supported LTHT in creating additional Foundation Year One posts to 

mitigate against the oversubscription. Posts were created in the Community 

Paediatrics and CYPMHS shared with LTHT acute on-call rotas. This provided an 

opportunity to gain experience of working in community earlier on in their medical career. Feedback from Doctors in training, the services and colleagues at LTHT has been very positive and resulted in the posts being embedded for the upcoming 

academic year. 

Teaching and training standards, and support are reviewed annually via the NHS 

England Self-Assessment Return \(SAR\), in which organisations carry out their own quality evaluation against the National Quality Framework. It is based on continuous quality improvement, the identification of quality improvement potential, the 

development of action plans, implementation, and subsequent evaluation. 

The Quality Framework identifies the standards that organisations are expected to meet to provide high quality learning environments. The education placements 

offered by LCH have been reviewed by Leeds University for undergraduate 

placements, and in May by NHSE for postgraduate and these reviews have been 

very positive. 

The NHS England National Education and Training Survey \(NETS\) is a national 

survey of healthcare trainees’ and students’ experiences of their education and 

training environments, gathering the views of c.40,000 respondents nationally in Page 6 of 9





2023. The Trust scored well across all domains and outperformed the National 

benchmarks. 

The Trust ranked as 1st in the Yorkshire and Humber Region based on ‘Overal

Learner experience’:

In NHS England’s ‘Education Quality Report’ they stated:

*“The trust is one of the best performing organisations within the GMC NTS. In 2024 *

*the trust ranked 21st of 230 UK acute, mental health and community trusts. The* *trust continues to receive positive feedback for the trust-wide teamwork indicator* *and in 2024 it was an above outlier. 100% of respondents agreed that the *

*organisation “encourages a culture of teamwork between multi-discipline healthcare* *professionals”. The indicator score has markedly improved from 2023 when it *

*scored 72.78, placing it in the lower quartile \(pink\), but scored 88.18 in 2024, placing* *it in the interquartile range \(white\). 81% of respondents now rate the quality of* *induction as “very good” or “good”.” *

**3 Impact**

**Position statement for 24/25**

**Principle 1: An effective environment \(Organisations create an environment **

**which delivers effective clinical governance for doctors\)**

LCH has a combination of individual service and central mechanisms which hold 

information pertinent to effective clinical governance for medical and dental staff. 

Each service is responsible for meetings and discussions regarding these, and 

medical and dental staff of all employment statuses are encouraged to participate and actively contribute. 

The Trust process in relation to incidents ensures that the Medical Directorate is informed when a doctor is involved in an incident, this allows appropriate support and oversight to the individual and the Business Unit involved. 

The four Trust policies related specifically to the employment of medical and dental staff were approved by SMT in 2021 and are in place, the policies are currently 

being reviewed. 

The Trust has robust processes in place to ensure appropriate checks are 

undertaken to confirm all doctors and dentists undertaking employed work in the 

Trust are appropriately qualified and fit for role. 

The Revalidation Team coordinate with Workforce and QPD colleagues to share 

information in order to provide central assurance of any issues relating to medical and dental staff. Revalidation Panels were carried out as required during 24/25, linking with Trust systems to ensure that appropriate submission and reflection on incidents and complaints was included in the relevant appraisals. 

The Trust has strong processes in place to support individuals who speak up and 

raise concerns; from the operational or clinical line manager of the individual, directly with an Executive Director or with the Freedom to Speak up Guardian. 

**Principle 2: Continuous Improvement \(Clinical governance processes for **

**doctors are managed and monitored with a view to continuous improvement\)**

Leeds Community Healthcare meets regularly with the GMC to discuss issues 

regarding incidents relating to doctors, and doctors in an MHPS process. Verbal 

feedback at the last meeting was complimentary of the processes in place and the open nature of the discussion, also reflective of the complexity of cases seen in this environment. 

The Medical Directorate proactively sought out partnering organisations to 

undertake a peer review of appraisal and revalidation processes. The Trust 

partnered with Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and 

Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust. The partnering 

organisations have built on that relationship to arrange a Mutual Quality Assurance process. The new process ensures that samples remain anonymous and are 

reviewed by people outside of the Trust, removing the risk of bias. 

Page 8 of 9

The Trust has presented information to both the University and NHSE on the quality of education provided at both an undergraduate and postgraduate level. There has been positive feedback from both meetings. Doctors are supported in their job plans to participate in education and training. 

**Principle 3: Fairness \(Safeguards are in place to ensure clinical governance **

**arrangements for doctors are fair and free from bias and discrimination\)**

Revalidation Panels ensure that all revalidation recommendations are supported by a thorough consideration of all aspects of the five years of appraisal preceding the recommendation. The panels strengthen the Trust processes and reduces the 

possibility of bias or discrimination with the introduction of an independent observer from a peer Trust. 

The Trust has a ‘Freedom to Speak Up Guardian’ \(FTSUG\). In 24/25 there were 5 

individual concerns/conversations from doctors, doctors in training and dentists with the FTSUG, this is on a background of 188 raised across the Trust. The number of staff raising concerns from medical and dental workforce is higher than the previous year of one report in 23/24. 

No concerns have been raised by any doctor in relation to decisions regarding the clinical governance of doctors; decisions relating to deferral of revalidation are usually made in conjunction with the doctors and in line with GMC guidance. 

During 24/25 there has been one grievance raised by a doctor or dentist employed by LCH, this has been managed appropriately. 

**Principle 4: Supporting Process \(Organisations deliver clinical governance **

**processes required to support medical revalidation and the evaluation of**

**doctors’ fitness to practice\)**

LCH has a longstanding history of robust clinical governance processes to support medical revalidation and has continued to perform well in this regard. Revalidation submission and recommendations are in line with the National average. 

Submissions summary - GDE \(gmc-uk.org\)

There are systems in place to respond and manage concerns related to the fitness to practice of doctors. These systems work in conjunction with the GMC and the 

Practitioners Performance Advice, part of NHS Resolution. This system will also 

address concerns related to locum doctors and doctors in training in conjunction with NHS England

1C – Recommendations to the GMC 

1C\(i\) Recommendations are made to the GMC about the fitness to practise of all doctors with a prescribed connection to our responsible officer, in accordance with the GMC requirements and responsible officer protocol, within the expected timescales, or where this does not occur, the reasons are recorded and understood. 





1 While there is no regulatory stipulation on appraiser/doctor ratios, a useful working benchmark is that an appraiser will undertake between 5 and 20 appraisals per year. This strikes a sensible balance between doing sufficient to maintain proficiency and not doing so many as to unbalance the appraiser’s scope of work. 





Action from last year: Continue to engage with the GMC appropriately. 



Comments: 

Regular Revalidation panels are held as required. The Executive 



Medical Director, Deputy Medical Director, and Head of Medical 



Education and Revalidation meet with the GMC Employee Liaison 



Advisor quarterly. 



Action for next year: 

Continue to engage with the GMC appropriately. 



1C\(ii\) Revalidation recommendations made to the GMC are confirmed promptly to the doctor and the reasons for the recommendations, particularly if the recommendation is one of deferral or non-engagement, are discussed with the doctor before the recommendation is submitted, or where this does not happen, the reasons are recorded and understood. 



Action from last year: 

No update required 

Comments: 

The outcome of Revalidation Panels is communicated directly with the 

doctor, indicating their revised revalidation date. The Responsible Officer 



made 7 positive recommendations to the GMC during the period 

covered by the report, all in a timely manner and supported by a 

Revalidation Panel. This covers all doctors for who recommendations 

were due during this period.

1F\(iii\) A system is in place to ensure that the values and behaviours around openness, transparency, freedom to speak up \(including safeguarding of whistleblowers\) and a learning culture exist and are continually enhanced within the organisation at all levels. 



Action from last year: 

Continue to monitor concerns raised** **

Comments: 

The Trust has in place a Speaking Up-Raising Concerns Policy which 



enables all staff to speak up at the earliest opportunity. It is authored by 

the Freedom to Speak up Guardian who addresses concerns from all 

staff groups. 

The Trust has a cultural approach called Speaking Up is a Practice Not 

a Position. This means that there are several speaking up channels at 

the trust. Staff are encouraged to use any of these channels to ensure 

their voice is heard. The mechanisms are: 



• Managers and colleagues 

• Easy Access to Senior Managers and Directors 

• Ask the CEO anonymous Q and A on the trust intranet 

• Trade Unions 

• Workforce Department \(HR\) 

• Freedom To Speak Up Guardian 

• Race Equality Network Speaking Up Champions 





In addition to this there are regular engagement meetings between all 

medical staff and the Medical Director, and the Resident doctors have 

regular meetings with the Guardian of Safe working hours, and the 

education team in which concerns can be raised. 



Action for next year: 

Continue to monitor concerns raised 

1F\(iv\) Mechanisms exist that support feedback about the organisation’ professional standards processes by its connected doctors \(including the existence of a formal complaints procedure\). 



Action from last year: 

Continue to monitor processes. In the last four years there have been no 

formal complaints and feedback is consistently good. ** **

Comments: 

The Trust policy on appraisal has an ability for doctor to raise a 



complaint or grievance from the appraisal process with the Responsible 

Officer or Deputy Medical Directors. If this process does not result in a 

satisfactory outcome the complaint can be raised with the Chief Exec of 

The Trust. 



The appraisal system utilised by the Trust allows feedback from 

appraisers to appraisees which is analysed and fed back. Any issues 

identified are addressed with individuals. 

Action for next year: 

Continue to monitor processes. In the last five years there have been no 



formal complaints and feedback is consistently good. 

1F\(v\) Our organisation assesses the level of parity between doctors involved in concerns and disciplinary processes in terms of country of primary medical qualification and protected characteristics as defined by the Equality Act.  



Action from last year: 

Continue to monitor concerns and processes in relation to involvement 



by doctors and protected characteristics. ** **

Comments: 

The Trust is aware of differential raising of concerns, entry into MHPS 



processes and referral to the GMC, in relation to country of primary 

medical qualification and protected characteristics. 

The number of doctors with a connection to LCH is relatively small and 

the number of doctors involved in incidents is small. It would be difficult 

to identify any concerns about issues, but we are vigilant and continue to 

question our processes and decisions. 



Action for next year: 

Continue to monitor concerns and processes in relation to involvement 



by doctors and protected characteristics. 



1G – Calibration and networking 

1G\(i\) The designated body takes steps to ensure its professional standards processes are consistent with other organisations through means such as, but not restricted to, attending network meetings, engaging with higher-level responsible officer quality review processes, engaging with peer review programmes. 





Action from last year: 

Continue to build on relationship with other Trusts and attend 

appropriate meetings** **

Comments: 

The Trust attends the regional RO and Appraisal Leads Networks, In the 



last year it has begun a peer review/support programme with two other 

similar Trust to explore processes and procedures and ensure learning 

is shared. The RO regularly meets with the regional GMC liaison officer.

**Section 3 – Summary and overall commentary **

This comments box can be used to provide detail on the headings listed and/or any other detail not included elsewhere in this report. 

Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust has a robust system in place for ensuring appraisal and revalidation of doctors employed by the Trust, for the appraisal of dentists and ensuring appropriate fitness to practice and fitness for role of other medical staff who work for the Trust. 39 doctors and 8 

dentists have had an annual appraisal for the year April 2024 and March 2025. 7 doctors have been successfully revalidated. 



The Trust has continued to provide high quality appraisal, supported and developed doctors and dentists regarding both appraisal and their general wellbeing, improved engagement with medical and dental staff and continued to further improve our systems to better support our medical and dental staff. 



Actions still outstanding 

Work identified in the 23/24 Medical Directors report to undertake an independent peer review of appraisal processes with Derbyshire and Birmingham Community NHS Trusts has completed the first 





stage, further steps are identified for progress during 25/26 including reversing the peer review triangulation, attending revalidation panels and completing a mutual quality assurance exercise. 



Current issues 



Actions for next year \(replicate list of ‘Actions for next year’ identified in Section 1\): 



• Further collaborative work planned with Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS 

Foundation Trust and Birmingham Community Health NHS Foundation Trust for 25/26 to include ongoing Quality Assurance and membership of Revalidation Panels. 

• Work to future proof the appraiser network, train at least one new appraiser for 25/26 appraisal cycle. 

• Complete the 25/26 Quality Assurance process with a reversed triangulation of the three Trusts, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS 

Foundation Trust and Birmingham Community Health NHS Foundation Trust. 

• Continue to engage with the GMC appropriately. 

• Continue to invite peer partner members to panels. 

• Continue to review guidelines as appropriate. 

• Continue to monitor compliance with the Equality act and work with the human resources team and groups within the organisation to ensure fairness is being delivered. 

• Continue to monitor concerns raised 

• Continue to monitor processes. In the last five years there have been no formal complaints and feedback is consistently good. 

• Continue to monitor concerns and processes in relation to involvement by doctors and protected characteristics. 

• Continue to build on relationship with other Trusts and attend appropriate meetings Overall concluding comments \(consider setting these out in the context of the organisation’s achievements, challenges and aspirations for the coming year\): 

**Achievements **

Leeds Community Healthcare meets regularly with the GMC to discuss issues regarding incidents relating to doctors, and doctors in an MHPS process. Verbal feedback at the last meeting was complimentary of the processes in place and the open nature of the discussion, also reflective of the complexity of cases seen in this environment. 

LCH has a longstanding history of robust clinical governance processes to support medical revalidation and has continued to perform well in this regard. Revalidation submission and recommendations are in line with the National average 

**Challenges** It has not been possible to progress the collection of meaningful data for non-procedure-based specialties and we note the national commissioning of outcomes which we hope will reflect our work. We will continue to explore useful data for meaningful benchmarking. 

The small number of medical staff in the organisation mean that remaining up to date with MHPS 

processes can be a challenge when looking for case investigators, as well as the familiarity with colleagues. 





**Aspirations** A further peer review and mutual quality assurance process is planned for 2025/26 with Birmingham and Derbyshire Community Trusts, with a view to ensuring processes are free from discrimination and bias.

**Significant Risks and Risk Assurance Report**

**1. Introduction**

1.1 The risk register report provides the Board with an overview of the Trust’s 

material risks currently scoring 15 and above \(extreme risks\). It summarises all risk movement, the risk profile, themes and risk activity since the last risk register report was received by the Board \(June 2025\). 

1.2 The Board’s role in scrutinising risk is to maintain a focus on those risks scoring 15 or above \(extreme risks\) and to be aware of risks currently scoring 12 \(high 

risks\). 

1.3 The report seeks to reassure the Board that there is a robust process in place in the Trust for managing risk. Themes identified from the risk register have been 

aligned with the BAF strategic risks to advise the Board of potential weaknesses in the control of strategic risks, where further action may be warranted. 

1.4 In addition to the risk register report information, the Trust’s updated risk appetite statement for 2025/26 is included in this report for approval by the Trust Board, see section 6 of the report.

At the time of writing the report, the Mind Mate Single Point of Access \(SPA\) risk is being re-assessed. Due to significant progress, the risk has reduced, and it is planned to separate into two risks: Emotional wellbeing waiting list and 

Neurodevelopmental waiting list. The reduction will be reflected in future risk 

reports.

Emotional wellbeing waiting list, it is proposed to reduce the score from 15 to 9. 

Commissioned Targeted Service Leader \(TSL\) and Northpoint \(NP\) work cleared 

original non-complex backlog of 657. Now working on 56 new referrals added to 

the non-complex list. Northpoint to address 207 remaining routine complex waiting list in September 2025. Letters sent to all routine waiters regarding the SPA 

including safety netting advice and signposting. Mind Mate website updated to this effect also. 

Action – Extend contracts for both TSL and NP until December 2025 to address 

new referrals and NP for complex list. 



Neurodevelopmental \(ND\) waiting list: - it is proposed to reduce this risk from 15 

to 12 with a further decrease on completion of the actions below. 

LCHT and ICB agreed to commission Northpoint to work on 1300 of 2675 waiting 

list over a 6-month period

**3. Summary of risks scoring 12 \(high\)**

3.1 To ensure continuous oversight of risks across the spectrum of severity, 

consideration of risk factors by the Board is not limited to extreme risks. Senior managers are sighted on services where the quality of care or service sustainability is at risk; many of these aspects of the Trust’s business being reflected in risks recorded as ‘high’ and particularly those scored at 12. The Quality and Business Committees have oversight of risks categorised as ‘high’ \(risks scored at 8 – 12\).

**6. Risk Appetite Statement 2025/26**

The Trust’s Risk Management Policy and Procedure stipulates that the risk appetite statement will be reviewed annually, and any proposed changes are to be approved by the Board. The Board reviewed the Trust’s risk appetite statement at its 

workshop held on 10 July 2025. The updated risk appetite statement for 2025/26 is attached at Appendix 1 for approval. 

**7. Impact**

**7.1Risk and assurance**

This report is part of the governance processes supporting risk management in that it provides information about the effectiveness of the risk management processes and the controls that are in place to manage the Trust’s most significant risks. 

**8. Next steps**

Risks will continue to be managed in accordance with the risk management policy 

and procedure, and the Board will receive an update report at the meeting to be 

held on 6th November 2025. 

**9. Recommendations**

The Board is recommended to:

• Note the changes to the significant risks since the last risk report was 

presented to the Board; 

• Consider whether the Board is assured that planned mitigating actions will 

reduce the risks; and

• Approve the risk appetite statement for 2025/26

**Board Risk Appetite Statement – Approved 4 September 2025**

**Risk 1 Failure to deliver high-quality, equitable care and continuous improvement:** If the Trust fails to identify, deliver, and sustain high-quality care, promote learning, and drive continuous improvement in an equitable manner, there is an increased risk of unsafe or ineffective services. This may lead to preventable harm, poor patient outcomes, and a diminished patient experience. 

**Avoid**

**Minimal**

**Cautious**

**Open**

**Seek**

**Mature**

Delivering equitably high-quality services is at the heart of the Trust’s way of working. The Trust is committed to the provision of consistent, personalised, safe and effective services. The Trust is supportive of innovation and will accept some risks to patient and service user experience if they are consistent with the achievement of patient safety and quality improvements. The Trust has a **cautious** appetite to risk that could compromise the delivery of equitably high quality, safe services. 

**Risk 2 Failure to respond to increasing demand for services:**

If the Trust fails to respond to population growth and presentation, and the consequent increase in demand, then the impact will be potential harm to patients, inability to strengthen equity of access, additional pressure on staff, financial consequences and reputational damage. 

**Avoid**

**Minimal**

**Cautious**

**Open**

**Seek**

**Mature**

The Trust is supportive of innovation and transformation and looks to **seek** measured risks in pursuing innovation and transformation of current working practices without compromising the quality of patient care. 



**Risk 3 Failure to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements. **

If the Trust is not compliant with legislation and does not adhere to relevant national frameworks, including embedding the findings from the Well-led developmental review, there is a risk to patient safety, governance, and performance which could impact on staff and patient safety. ** **

**Avoid**

**Minimal**

**Cautious**

**Open**

**Seek**

**Mature**

We have a **minimal** risk appetite to risks which will impact on our ability to meet our legislative and regulatory compliance requirements. Where the laws, regulations and standards are about the delivery of safe, high-quality care, or the health and safety of the staff and public, we will make every effort to meet regulator expectations and comply with laws, regulations and standards that have been set. 

**Risk 4 Failure to deliver financial sustainability:**

If the Trust cannot manage its resources effectively, ensuring that spending does not exceed available funding, then this could jeopardise delivery of our strategic goals and priorities. 

**Avoid**

**Minimal**

**Cautious**

**Open**

**Seek**

**Mature**

Our appetite for financial risk is **cautious, **whilst remaining compliant with statutory requirements. We strive to deliver our services within the budgets set out in our financial plans and are open to measured risks that will support innovation and transformation to achieve long term financial sustainability, improvements to service delivery, patient safety and quality of care. 

We will ensure that all such financial responses deliver optimal value for money. We adopt a zero-tolerance approach to fraud. 



**Risk 5 Failure to maintain business continuity: **

If the Trust is unable to maintain business continuity in the event of significant disruption, in the short \(less than one week\) or longer term \(above 1 week\), then essential services will not be able to operate, leading to patient harm, reputational damage, and financial loss. 

**Avoid**

**Minimal**

**Cautious**

**Open**

**Seek**

**Mature**

The Trust has a **minimal** risk appetite to business continuity risks impacting on maintaining Category 1 \(C1\) rated critical service elements, information security and cyber security. In responding to such incidents, Category 2 and 3 service elements could be temporarily stood down to provide additional capacity to support critical C1 service elements. 

**Risk 6 Failure to effectively engage staff and leaders as well as to support their health and well-being in the current** **context:**

If the Trust is unable to effectively engage and motivate all staff including leaders through impactful health and well-being interventions, a focus on inclusion, excellent leadership development and support in the current challenging context, then the impact will be a reduction in the overall quality of care and staff wellbeing and a possible misalignment with the key objectives of the Trust. 

**Avoid**

**Minimal**

**Cautious**

**Open**

**Seek**

**Mature**

While we will not accept risks which may compromise the safety of our staff or that contradict our Trust values, we acknowledge that transforming services to ensure their future sustainability will require changes in staffing models and an agile, resilient workforce. We have a **cautious** appetite to risks associated with the implementation of new models of working where these enhance or improve patient safety, quality of care or service delivery. We will support our people to adapt and thrive during change. 



**Risk 7 Failure to reduce inequalities experienced by the population we serve:** If the Trust fails to address the inequalities built into its own systems and processes, there is a risk that we are inadvertently delivering unfair access or care and exacerbating inequalities in health outcomes within some cohorts of the population **Avoid**

**Minimal**

**Cautious**

**Open**

**Seek**

**Mature**

The Trust is committed to promoting equity in access, experience, and outcomes. The Trust will **seek** opportunities for collaboration with people and communities to ensure their experience influences equitable approaches to innovation and transformation, such as for the Quality and Value Programme. To deliver outcomes that are inclusive of an equity focus. 

**Risk 8 Failure to collaborate:**

If the Trust fails to develop further partnerships across a wide range of stakeholder organisations, then the system will not provide integrated service offers, achieve the best outcomes for citizens, or optimise business development opportunities. 

**Avoid**

**Minimal**

**Cautious**

**Open**

**Seek**

**Mature**

We are committed to bringing value and opportunity across current and future services through system-wide partnership and **seek** risks associated with collaborative and new ways of working. This includes seeking opportunities to work with partners to deliver the neighbourhood health model and other drivers outlined in the 10 year plan, alongside the findings of the Leeds Provider review. 



**Risk Appetite Target Scores**

The risk appetite is defined by the ‘Good Governance Institute risk appetite for NHS organisations’ matrix, which Leeds Community Healthcare Trust has adopted. This has been aligned to the Trust’s own risk assessment matrix as shown in the table below.

**Board Assurance Framework – Quarterly Update**

**1. Introduction**

1.1 In June 2025 the Board received a report summarising the processes 

undertaken to review the BAF in readiness for the 2025/26 financial year. At that meeting the Board approved the eight Strategic Risks for 2025/26. 

**2. Quarterly Review of Strategic Risks**

2.1 During June 2025, meetings were held with the Executive Directors in order to undertake the first quarterly review of the 2025/26 BAF. Each strategic risk has been reviewed in terms of the following: 

• Operation of the current controls / whether any additional or gaps in controls need to be added

• Progress against the actions

• Impact of the actions on the score

• Any further actions identified to reduce the risk to target

• Whether there are any missing sources of assurance that need to be added. 

The key changes for each strategic risk are outlined on page 3 of the attached BAF. 

2.2 On 10 July the Board agreed it’s risk appetite at a Board development session, and this information was added into the BAF document. 

2.3 A full review of the BAF was then undertaken by the Trust Leadership Team in July 2025 to ensure that it is reflective of the associated high-level risks aligned to the Trust’s strategic objectives. 

2.4 During July 2025 the Audit, Quality and Business Committees reviewed the 

strategic risks for which they have oversight, considered the sources of assurance and allocated an assurance rating to each risk from the information presented to them, shared with Board via their Committee Escalation and Assurance reports. 

The outputs of those discussions is visible on pages 4 and 5 of the attached BAF. It should be noted that the People and Culture Committee will also be responsible for reviewing a strategic risk \(SR6\), but it has not met in this period so has not allocated an assurance rating for it’s strategic risk as yet. 

2.5 The Board is reminded that the BAF is presented here for assurance on its 

completeness as of August 2025. 

**3. Next Steps**

3.1 All strategic risks will continue to be assigned to an Executive Director and to a Committee\(s\) for oversight. The Executive Directors will maintain oversight of the strategic risks assigned to them and will review these risks on a quarterly basis to continually evaluate the effectiveness of the controls in place that are managing the risk and identify any gaps that require further action. 

3.2 The Committees will continue to be required to report to the Trust Board 

following each meeting via the Committee Escalation and Assurance reports on 

Page 3 of 4

whether the risks to the success of its strategic objectives are being managed effectively. 

3.3 The BAF will subsequently be reviewed on a quarterly basis and the outcome 

shared with the Board.

**Recommendations**

The Board is recommended to:

• Receive the BAF and to be assured of the appropriateness of updates, including risk scoring and mitigating actions.

**Board Assurance Framework \(BAF\) 2025/2026**

**Introduction**

The Board Assurance Framework \(BAF\) provides the Board with a register of strategic risks that have the potential to impact on the achievement of the Trust’s strategic objectives and gives assurances that the risks are being managed effectively. The Framework aligns strategic risks with the strategic objectives and highlights key controls and assurances. 

Where gaps are identified, or key controls and assurances are insufficient to manage the risk to acceptable levels \(within the Trust risk appetite\), action needs to be taken. Planned actions will enable the Board to monitor progress in addressing gaps or weaknesses and to ensure that resources are allocated appropriately. 

The risk appetite relates to the Trust’s willingness to take risks / opportunities to achieve the strategic goals, the risk tolerance score indicates the maximum acceptable risk. Risk appetite and risk tolerance are used to support decision making at a strategic level. 

**Assurance**

The Board receives the BAF quarterly. The risks aligned to the Board Committees are also reported to the relevant Committee bi-monthly, where the relevant Committee agrees a level of assurance for each risk. 

The BAF provides the basis for the preparation of a fair and representative Annual Governance Statement. It is the subject of annual review by both Internal and External Audit. 

**Trust Objectives \(Strategic Goals\) with the underpinning 2025/26 Trust Priorities** Strategic Goal - Work with communities to deliver personalised care

• *Trust Priority: We will provide proactive and timely care that is person centred by ensuring the right service delivers the right care at the right* *time by the right practitioner. *

Strategic Goal - Enable our workforce to thrive and deliver the best possible care

• *Trust Priority: To have a well led, supported, inclusive and valued workforce* Strategic Goal – Collaborating with partners to enable people to live better lives

• *Trust Priority: We will develop a Leeds Community Collaborative in partnership to amplify the community voice and facilitate care closer to* *home. *

Strategic Goal - To embed equity in all that we do

• *Trust Priority –To ensure that the Quality and Value Programme has the least negative impact on those with the most need and positively* *impacts where possible. *

Strategic Goal - Use our resources wisely and efficiently both in the short and longer term

• *Trust Priority: To achieve the 2024/25 Trust’s financial efficiency target through delivery of an effective Quality and Value Programme* **Risk Scoring**

Each strategic risk is assessed \(measured\) in terms of consequence \(how bad could it be\) and likelihood \(how likely is it to happen\). The risk score is calculated by multiplying the consequence by the likelihood. 

To maintain an objective and consistent approach across the organisation, the Trust’s risk assessment matrix is used to ‘score’ each risk, see below: **LIKELIHOOD**

**Strategic Risk 1: **

**Failure to deliver high-quality, equitable care and continuous improvement:**

If the Trust fails to identify, deliver, and sustain high-quality care, promote learning, and drive continuous improvement in an equitable manner, there is an increased risk of unsafe or ineffective services. This may lead to preventable harm, poor patient outcomes, and a diminished patient experience.

embedded. 

**Rationale for Target Score \(including any constraints to reaching risk appetite within the next 12 months\):** The elevated risk score reflects the early stage of the Q&V programme, where the full scope and impact of changes to patient pathways are not yet fully understood. Until greater clarity is achieved, uncertainty remains regarding the potential effects on care quality. As the programme progresses and mitigation strategies take effect, the risk is expected to decrease. However, due to the programme’s three-year timescale, it is unlikely that the risk will fall within the organisation’s risk appetite in the next 6 months. A reduction in score is projected by **March 2026**, after which further progress is expected toward reaching the target and aligning with risk appetite.

**Changes to Non-Executive Director roles and responsibilities**

➢

**1 Introduction**

Following the end of tenure of Brodie Clark CBE as Trust Chair in August 2025, a review of Non-Executive Director roles and responsibilities has taken place. The following paper outlines the interim arrangements while the Leeds Provider Review work is ongoing. 

➢

**2 Interim Trust Chair and Deputy Chair**

It has been agreed with NHS England that Helen Thomson, Deputy Lieutenant, ** **will be undertaking** **the role of Interim Trust Chair from 11 August 2025. An expressions of interest process resulted in Ian Lewis becoming the Trust’s Interim Deputy Chair from the same date. 

➢

**3 Other roles**

➢

➢

It has been agreed that Rachel Booth will undertake the role of Senior Independent Director during this interim period, supporting the Chair, providing an independent perspective on governance issues; and carrying out the Chair’s annual appraisal. 

➢

Helen Thomson will retain the additional role of Freedom to Speak up champion. 

**4 Committee Membership Proposal**

The Trust is considered not to have a Non-executive Director vacancy at the current time due to Helen Thomson acting into the Interim Chair role, and so the Committee membership has been reviewed based on the current allocation of Non-Executive 

and Associate Non-Executive Directors, in line with their skills and experience. 

The arrangements includes cross-membership of Business Committee and People 

and Culture Committee to ensure good communication. Further to this, the agendas for each Committee also include an opportunity for escalation of items to other 

Committees.

**5 Risk and assurance**

If the Board’s Committees do not have a combination of appropriate skills, 

experience and knowledge, there may be an insufficient level of scrutiny and 

challenge. This could impact on the achievement of the Trust’s strategic objectives. 

**6**

**Next steps**

No changes are required to Committee terms of references at present.
