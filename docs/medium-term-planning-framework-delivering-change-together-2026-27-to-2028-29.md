**Foreword**

Dear colleague, 

Today we are publishing the Medium Term Planning Framework – delivering change together 2026/27 to 2028/29 – marking the beginning of a new way of working in the NHS. 

It **signals the end of the short-termism** that has held the local NHS back for so long, providing local leadership teams and boards with the opportunity to break the cycle of ‘just about managing’ by creating the environment and headroom to fix the fundamental problems we face, while in parallel improving care in the immediate term. 

It further **closes the gap between the national centre and service**: the fact that much of what is contained within this document has been co-produced with hundreds of leaders from primary care, acute, mental health, ambulance and community services is testimony to the collective desire to genuinely embrace the change the public told us all they wanted, and drive improvement in every part of the country. 

But most importantly, **it marks the return of locally-led ambition** in the NHS – creating the platform for NHS boards and leaders to truly listen to their communities and drive the change they want and need. 

And we’re already seeing the early impact that new-found ambition is having: for the first time in years, elective waiting lists have started to fall, access to primary care is improving with more people saying it’s easier to contact their GP 

than a year ago, corridor care incidents have fallen sharply and 12 hour waits are down year-on-year for the first time since the pandemic. We’ve even seen a sharper uptake in flu vaccinations across staff and the public in the early part of this year’s campaign. 

The same commitment to accelerating improvement is going to need to be seen right across the NHS as we go into the next few months: we need to deliver a strong and safe winter, continue our drive to improve elective performance and maintain our firm grip on the money as this is what unlocks future freedoms. 

Just a few short months ago we published the 10 Year Health Plan: today’s publication shows how that reform agenda will drive faster delivery of care now while creating a platform for sustained improvement in the future. It completely rewires how the NHS works, setting out how a new operating model and financial regime will rightly return freedom and innovation to the frontline of the NHS. 

Resetting these foundations will enable the NHS to accelerate the delivery of neighbourhood health services, radically transform its approach to quality, and finally embrace the opportunities of digital health to drive improvements in every aspect of its work. 

3





All of this means that the NHS is now able to commit to even more ambitious delivery targets across cancer, urgent care, waiting times, access to primary and community care, mental health, learning disabilities and autism, and dentistry. At the same time, the Planning Framework sees a return to some of the basics that have taken a back seat over the last decade: ensuring providers take the time to better understand what their patients and staff are telling them, and making sure they take action when they fall short. 

In short, this is the most ambitious plan the NHS has published in a generation. Over the next 3 years it will return the NHS to much better health – with waiting times dramatically reduced, access to local care restored to the level patients and communities expect, and unnecessary bureaucracy slashed so that savings are poured back into frontline services and staff. 

None of what is set out in this Framework is going to be easy to deliver – 

but the emerging energy for change generated through the 10 Year Health Plan has started to create new optimism in the NHS. 

We will continue to challenge ourselves when we fall short of what patients and communities need. Equally, we give you a clear commitment to break down any unnecessary barriers in your way – as we hope we have started to demonstrate over the course of this year. 

Our collective challenge goes well beyond improving the care we provide our patients – it’s about ensuring we are the community of staff and leaders that seize the opportunity to put the NHS on a sustainable footing: safeguarding it for generations to come, winning back the public’s faith, and most importantly saving, extending and improving many more lives. 

Thank you to all of you who have committed time and effort this year 

– either through contributing to the 10 Year Health Plan or helping shape this new approach to delivery. Keep up the hard work – it’s very much appreciated.

## submission

### 36

The 10 Year Health Plan stipulates that organisations should develop 5-year strategic plans that set out how they will deliver the 3 shifts and improve productivity of their services. These 5-year plans will need to be supported by 3-year numerical returns that describe what the organisation will deliver from 2026 to 2029. This timetable sets out the key outputs expected from the NHS and describes the planning process across the 3 phases. 

The planning timetable - expectations for phase 2

Organisations will be expected to submit their 3 year plans as part of their first submission. This will be reviewed and assured by NHS England regional teams. Regional teams will provide feedback on the plans, and organisations will resubmit, alongside their 5-year strategic plans.
