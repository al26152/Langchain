NHS productivity 



**Summary **

This briefing focuses on productivity in the NHS in England, which has become 

an issue of increasing importance for policymakers in recent years. 

A central element of recent NHS financial strategy in England has been a 

target of 2% annual productivity growth.  This is intended to reverse the reported decline in NHS productivity seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, 

which has not yet been fully recovered. 

This briefing sets out how and why healthcare productivity is measured, 

reflecting different views on what should be measured and what different 

measures mean. It also lays out recent trends in NHS productivity, the 

explanations given for these trends, and outlines the potential changes that 

have been proposed to increase productivity.

NHS productivity 



**1** 

**What is healthcare productivity? **

Healthcare encompasses all activity that aims to promote, restore or 

maintain health. Productivity, as defined by economists, is a measure of how 

well resources \(inputs\) are transformed into products and services \(outputs\). 

Increased productivity is generally seen as outputs increasing in relation to 

inputs. Increased healthcare productivity would mean delivering more 

healthcare activities relative to the level of resource \(for example, staff time 

and money\). 

Increasing NHS productivity doesn’t mean that doctors, nurses or other NHS 

staff must work harder. The Health Foundation has noted that sustained 

improvements in NHS productivity will depend on the system ‘working better’, 

involving the workforce, the way buildings and equipment are used, and the 

range of treatments and technologies on offer. 1 It may mean healthcare professionals doing less administration, spending less time on ‘unproductive 

things’, like struggling with broken equipment or IT, or seeing patients who 

are well enough to leave the ward but still in hospital because there is no 

community bed to discharge them to. In this scenario healthcare staff should 

be enabled to focus on more ‘productive things’, like caring for unwell 

patients, performing operations or procedures, and seeing patients in clinic. 

There are concerns that productivity measures in healthcare focus on activity 

outputs, such as operations and scans, and fail to measure patient outcomes 

\(including the slowing of disease progression or the prevention of secondary 

conditions and complications, for example in diabetes\). 2 

There are also concerns that focusing on hospital productivity measures may 

place less emphasis on the benefits of public health and prevention policies. 3 

This may mean that increased healthy life expectancy or the economic activity 

which may result from health improvement policies, are not captured as in 

measures of NHS productivity. 

The terms productivity and efficiency are sometimes used interchangeably, 

but the terms can be used and understood in different ways. Whereas 

efficiency implies doing the same thing but with less waste, ‘doing things 

right’, productivity suggests a focus on ‘doing the right things’. 4

1.1 

What has government said about NHS 

productivity? 

Towards the end of the previous Conservative Government, there had been a 

growing acknowledgement that action was needed to improve NHS 

productivity. In the Spring Budget in March 2024 the then Chancellor, Jeremy 

Hunt, announced a Public Sector Productivity Programme. This included an 

announcement of new funding worth £3.4bn to the NHS, tied to a commitment 

to deliver 1.9% average annual productivity increases between 2025/26 and 

2029/30 \(rising to 2% in the final 2 years\). 5 

Following the 2024 general election, the Labour Government commissioned 

Lord Darzi to assess the state of the NHS. The final report of the investigation 

\(‘the Darzi report’\) was published on 12th September 2024 and included a 

number of references to low productivity in the NHS. 6 The report concluded that this was largely because patients do not flow through the system and 

staff have to spend time dealing with process issues. He also emphasised the 

need to invest in technology in the NHS, including AI, digital health records, 

and patient-facing digital tools, to both improve NHS productivity and patient 

outcomes. Lord Darzi concluded that these aspects should be included in the 

NHS 10 Year Plan. 

The Autum Budget, on 30th October 2024, committed the NHS to achieving a 

2% productivity growth target in 2025/26, with £2bn allocated to enhancing 

NHS technology and digital infrastructure, to improve productivity. 7 

Speaking to the BBC’s World at One programme on 31st October 2024, Wes 

Streeting said extra money for the NHS was being tied to reform. 8 

The annual operational planning guidance published by NHS England in 

January 2025 said NHS organisations need to achieve 4% improvement in 

productivity in 2025/2026. 9

Spring Budget 2024, 6 March 2024. The day after the 2024 Spring Budget, the then Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Victoria Atkins, gave a speech about productivity at the Nuffield Trust Summit \(The 2024 Budget and NHS productivity, 7 March 2024\). Further background on productivity ambitions in the June 2023 NHS workforce plan can be found in the Library briefing The 

NHS workforce in England.

**The 10 Year Health Plan **

The government's 10 Year Health Plan for England, “Fit for the Future” was 

published on Thursday 3 July 2025. 10 At the heart of the plan are three strategic “shifts”: 

• from delivering care in hospitals to delivering care closer to home, in 

communities and in primary care 

• to digital transformation of service delivery 

• from a service treating sickness to one focused on preventing illness 

occurring in the first place 

The plan details how the £29bn real terms increase in day-to-day spending 

for the NHS, over the next 3 years \(as announced in the 2025 Spending 

Review\) will fund reforms, service improvements, and the new technology 

required to achieve these aims. 

The plan states “we will need to urgently resolve the NHS productivity crisis”, 

referring to a sharp decline in productivity seen during the COVID-19 

pandemic, and the Bank of England’s assessment that NHS productivity is a 

factor influencing wider economic performance: 

The one-off cash injection into healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, 

coupled with sharp cuts to activity, resulted in a 20% to 25% drop in measured 

NHS productivity from which we have not yet fully recovered. This is not just an 

issue for the NHS: the Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey has 

publicly identified NHS productivity as a factor dragging down economy-wide 

productivity. This is not sustainable. Improving productivity is a central goal of 

the reforms outlined in this plan. 11 

The plan reiterates the 2% year-on-year productivity gain target, over three 

years. To support this goal, the government has commissioned a review by 

Andy Haldane, former Chief Economist at the Bank of England. The review will 

assess historical trends and the NHS’s current strategy, informing the 

development of a new NHS Productivity Index to track performance at 

national, regional, and provider levels. Findings are expected in autumn 2025. 

This 10 Year Health Plan has also stated that cutting excessive bureaucracy, 

improving supply chains, and giving new powers to the National Institute for 

Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\), to withdraw recommendations for treatments which are no longer cost-effective, will increase productivity \(NICE 

provides recommendations to clinicians and commissioners in the NHS on 

what the NHS should fund in England\). One way of increasing productivity 

suggested in the plan is the implementation of ambient technology \(which 

uses large language models to record conversations and convert them to 

medical notes and discharge letters\).

Other changes in the plan include implementing new ways of payment for 

NHS providers, as well as changes to provision for capital infrastructure. This 

includes a plan to ‘deconstruct block contracts’, with a stated intention to 

give bonus payments for high quality care and withhold payments for low-

quality care.

**Measuring NHS productivity **

2.1 

Why does measuring NHS productivity matter? 

Productivity is used by policy makers, parliamentarians and the public as a 

metric of performance for the NHS in England. Annual government health 

spending accounts for 10% of GDP, and 41.5% of total public service 

expenditure in 2021. 12 In the context of limited resources, growing demand from an ageing population and the general trend for healthcare costs to 

increase faster than inflation, there is particular interest in understanding if 

the NHS can use resources more effectively, to deliver more healthcare, and 

to improve patient outcomes. For example, by changing the way a clinic 

works to see more unwell patients that need to be seen, and less patients who 

are well and don’t need an appointment. 

**Productivity and NHS funding **

Measuring NHS productivity growth is also an important tool for assessing 

future funding needs. 

The NHS budget for 2024/25 was £177bn, and for 2025/26 it is £183bn. The 

Health Foundation projected NHS funding needs depending on different levels 

of productivity growth and found that by 2028/29: 

– If productivity rises by 1%, NHS funding will need to be £211bn \(4.8% 

annual growth\) 

– If productivity rises by 2%, NHS funding will need to be £198bn \(2.7% 

annual growth\) 

– Continuing these projection differences, by 2034 this will equate to a 

£20bn funding difference 13

NHS productivity 



2.2 

How is productivity measured? 

Productivity is usually calculated as the value of output produced divided by 

an input – often the number of workers or hours worked. 

Productivity in the health sector is more difficult to measure. The main 

problem is that, unlike the market sector economy, most healthcare in the UK 

is free to use and doesn’t have a market price. 14 

In its most basic form, a hospital’s productivity could be calculated by 

measuring: 

• **Input**: for example, the number of staff or equipment, such as scanners, 

the hospital uses and pays for \(or it can be defined as inflation adjusted 

spend\) 

• **Output**: the number of procedures the hospital performs, the number of 

patients seen in clinic, or the number admitted to hospital. 

**Complexity of measuring input **

The simplest way of measuring input to the NHS would be by calculating how 

much is spent on wages for healthcare staff, equipment such as MRI 

scanners, buildings and investment in digital technology. However, this would 

not include other important inputs, for example, areas of public health 

spending that historically have been excluded from productivity 

measurement. 

The amount spent on each specific service area is also not always clear. It 

can also be difficult to compare spending on wider areas, for example 

outpatient services vs prevention services. 

**Complexity of measuring output **

The simplest way of measuring outputs would be to calculate things like: 

• 

the number of hospital admissions, consultations and outpatient 

appointments performed by healthcare staff 

• 

the number of operations, procedures and diagnostic tests 

• 

the number of medications prescribed 



14 the NHS is mainly funded through general taxation, with a small proportion of funding in England raised from patient charges for services such as prescriptions and dental treatment. There are also private providers of healthcare, and in some cases NHS services are provided by non-NHS 

organisations, however NHS funded services are always provided ‘free at the point of use’. 



11 

Commons Library Research Briefing, 23 July 2025 

NHS productivity 



• 

the number of GP appointments 

However, the value of each of these ‘outputs’ is not equal. For example, a 

consultation in clinic is not of equal value to a drug which is prescribed, nor is 

either equal to a simple elective operation, or an urgent emergency 

operation. For this reason, a unit cost theory is used. This means that the 

value of each activity is the same as its cost. Sometimes however, the value of 

an activity is different to its cost. So an operation may be very cheap to 

perform, but its value is very high as it has a significant impact on the health 

of a person. 

Aggregating very diverse healthcare activities into a measure of NHS output 

requires a value weight to be applied, reflecting the value that these activities 

have to the patient. However, such values do not exist in a system where NHS 

services do not have a market sector price. For this reason, the Office for 

National Statistics \(ONS\) and the Centre for Health Economics’ \(University of 

York\)15 measures of NHS output using cost weights, which reflect a producer evaluation, and indicators of quality of care \(e.g. in-hospital survival, patient-reported outcome measures, waiting time, patient’s experience\), to adjust 

their cost-weighted output measure. This approach was recommended in the 

ONS national accounts and in the Atkinson review, an independent review of 

the measurement of government output in the national accounts published in 

2005. 16 

Adjusting cost measures to reflect value takes time and means that statistics 

take longer to produce and partly explains why ONS’ main estimates of 

productivity are published with a 2-year lag. 

2.3 

How different organisations measure NHS 

productivity 

Different organisations measure NHS productivity in different ways. This 

section will lay out some of the nuances of how healthcare inputs and outputs 

are measured by different organisations, including the extent to which they 

apply quality adjustments to outputs. 

**Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) **

The ONS produces official national statistics estimating annual healthcare 

productivity. They are released with a 2-year lag and cover the whole of the 

UK \(they also identify England-level productivity separately\). 



15 The Centre for Health economics at the University of York produce annual estimates of productivity growth in the English NHS and work with the ONS to provide data on quality adjustment. 

16 The national accounts are the ONS framework bringing together units and transactions to provide simple descriptions of production, income, consumption and wealth. 



12 

Commons Library Research Briefing, 23 July 2025 

NHS productivity 



Where possible, the ONS includes a quality-adjusted measure of output. This 

means, in addition to counting the number of operations, appointments, 

prescriptions and other health treatments, it considers short-term post-

operative survival rates, health-gains from procedures, wait times and 

patient satisfaction surveys. 

Given the complexity of these calculations, they often rely on multiple 

assumptions. As well as the annual estimate, the ONS also provides quarterly 

estimates. These are short-term measures that are less detailed than the 

annual statistics, with no quality adjustment, and which are generally 

corrected at a later date. 

**Quality adjustment used by the ONS **

• 

Changes in short-term post-operative survival rates 

• 

Waiting times 

• 

Estimates of the health improvement as a result of hospital 

procedures 

• 

Rates of adherence to GP incentive schemes 

• 

Results from patient satisfaction surveys 



**NHS England **

NHS England \(NHSE\) produces in-year productivity statistics. The last was 

published in March 2025. 17 This covers only acute hospital services in England, excluding community and mental health data. NHSE also calculate and 

disseminate monthly acute productivity statistics by trust through the Model 

Health System. 18 

NHSE productivity statistics differ from those that are published by the ONS, 

as NHSE has access to a broader set of healthcare data, allowing them to 

address potential data quality issues. For instance, they can adjust for 

missing or under-reported data. NHSE also reports that it is able to reflect 

growth in treatment intensity, something the ONS are not able to do in their 

quarterly estimates.

18 NHS England, The Model Health System 



13 

Commons Library Research Briefing, 23 July 2025 

NHS productivity 



This has in the past resulted in higher productivity estimates than those 

reported by the ONS. 19 

**Centre for Health Economics, University of York **

The Centre for Health Economics at the University of York produce their 

estimate of NHS productivity which is based on slightly different sources to 

the ONS. This report uses more detailed patient-level information, which the 

UK National Statisticians’ review suggested the ONS also consider using. 20 

They also provide the ONS with the hospital quality indicators, which ONS 

uses to quality-adjust their measure of NHS output growth and productivity. 

The University of York measure focuses exclusively on NHS-provided health 

care goods and services \(inpatient, outpatient, primary care, community 

prescribing, amongst other goods and services\), using data for the English 

NHS. Other government spending on health care, such as public health 

services which may be provided by local authorities, is not included. 

**Institute for Fiscal Studies \(IFS\) **

The IFS use a simpler measure of NHS productivity, focusing on hospital 

activity only as the output, and on hospital staffing as the input. 21 This gives a measure of hospital labour productivity, i.e. the number of patients treated 

per staff member. 

This does not account for the quality of care delivered, or the amount of care 

required by each patient, but using a simpler measure means the IFS 

estimates allow more real-time monitoring of productivity. 

Analysis by the IFS excludes primary care, whilst analysis of devolved nations 

is produced separately.

2.4 

Issues in measuring productivity 

**National statisticians independent review of public **

**service productivity measurement **

The ONS has acknowledged that measuring public service productivity is 

challenging. 22 

A review of the way public sector productivity statistics are compiled, led by 

the National Statistician in 2023, highlighted the difficulty of measuring 

healthcare productivity. It also noted areas where improvements in the 

delivery of healthcare were not reflected in the productivity statistics. This 

review highlighted several issues in how productivity is measured. For 

instance: 

• 

excess \(i.e. unnecessary\) bed days23 were counted as additional 

outputs despite being a barrier to productivity 

• 

the value of screening programmes have not been taken into 

account as outputs 

• 

quality adjustment was only applied to elective procedures 

• 

cost-weighting, where a value is assigned to an activity based on 

its cost, led to inaccurate measures of productivity. For example, 

if you introduce a cheaper method of hip replacement, the value 

of the output falls, so productivity, as it is measured, falls. This is 

despite the same number of hip-replacements being done at a 

cheaper cost 

**Measuring productivity across all parts of the NHS **

Another issue highlighted by the National Statistician’s review is that hospital 

sector productivity may vary significantly from other parts of the healthcare 

system \(such as general practice or community health services\). 

Given the divergence between different areas of healthcare, and the scale of 

expenditure, the review suggests that productivity growth should be 

examined separately in different parts of the healthcare system. 



22 UK Statistics Authority. https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/national-statisticians-

independent-review-of-the-measurement-of-public-services-productivity/pages/1/. May 2025 

23 Excess bed days is a technical term relating to spells of care where the length of stay is longer than 1.5 standard deviations from the median. This includes unnecessary stays but may also include stays where more complex or specialist care is required. 



15 

Commons Library Research Briefing, 23 July 2025 

NHS productivity 



**Concerns about the use of NHS productivity measures **

As long as there have been attempts to use productivity statistics to 

implement changes to the NHS, 24 there have been counter-arguments that productivity measures are inaccurate and should not from the basis for policy 

decisions. 25 In response, organisations such as the ONS have attempted to introduce adjustments to improve how productivity data is collected and 

measured. 26 

In an article in the Lancet in April 2025, academics argue that productivity 

should not be the primary focus of policy makers. They argue that targets and 

statistics mean little to patients who are more interested in the quality of care 

they receive and the interactions they have with the NHS. 27 They also argue that a focus on productivity leads to distraction from prevention and primary 

care, due to less availability of data in these contexts, and leads to 

investment in the ‘wrong answers’. 

They also question whether investment in technology will lead to productivity 

gains in the NHS. They state that there is no clarity on how health 

technologies will improve productivity, and that they may also increase 

demand \(for instance by people using home screening tests\). 

Other activities such as training and research are not captured by health 

productivity statistics, despite a 42% rise in medical students between 2011 

and 2021, and an 8% rise in nursing students between 2015 and 2021. 28 

In addition, the Nuffield Trust and the Kings fund have stated that the 

language of productivity does not resonate with clinicians and managers, 

preventing them from engaging with initiatives to address low productivity, 

resulting in ‘unproductive conversations’. 29, 30

**Trends in healthcare productivity **

There is widespread agreement that NHS productivity is not as high as it was 

prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The precise estimates of productivity 

however differ depending on which organisation is measuring it. This section 

highlights the current estimates of healthcare productivity, as well as recent 

trends. 

3.1 

Recent estimates of NHS productivity 

**Key trends **

While precise estimates vary, most organisations that measure NHS 

productivity in England, or across the UK, note the following recent trends: 

• 

There was a big drop in NHS productivity during and immediately 

after COVID-19 

• 

In the last 2-3 years, year-on-year NHS productivity is rising but 

has not recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels 

As noted above, the most reliable statistics \(produced by the ONS and 

University of York\) have a two-year lag and more recent figures are likely to 

be revised. 

Key information on metrics used in the main NHS productivity estimates are 

outlined in the table below.

**Increased spending and reduced activity during the pandemic **

During the pandemic, there was a large increase in spending on healthcare, 

primarily on activity related to the pandemic. This was however outweighed 

by the fall in primary care activity and other routine hospital services. This 

resulted in a 25% decline in productivity according to the ONS. 38 

**Increased activity \(output\) since the pandemic **

NHS productivity 



appointments and emergency admissions was higher in 2024 than previous 

years, and it was also higher than 2019. 

**Increase in output not to same degree as increase in input **

IFS analysis, which compares activity in hospitals to staffing levels, shows 

that activity has not increased by the same proportion as staffing. 

Between January and July 2024, the NHS had 18.2% more consultants, and 

22.9% more nurses compared to 2019. However, it only delivered 9.1% more 

elective admissions and 12.1% more outpatient appointments. 40 This means that labour productivity \(i.e. output per staff member\) is lower than it was 

pre-pandemic in 2019. 

The biggest rise in outputs is elective and day-case care, which, according to 

the University of York, grew by 10.3% between 2021/22 and 2022/23. 

Emergency care activity fell by 1.2% between 2021/22 and 2022/23. 41 

3.2 

Pre-COVID-19 trends 

Prior to the pandemic, most datasets show that productivity was increasing. 

The ONS estimates that between 1995 and 2016, NHS productivity grew by 

0.9% per year on average. 42 Between 2010/11 and 2016/17, productivity increased by 2.1% per year on average.

and Commons Library calculations 

The University of York’s more detailed assessment of NHS productivity 

estimates average productivity growth of 0.3% between 2005/5 and 2022/23. 

In analysis which excluded the pandemic years, average productivity growth 

from 2004/05 to 2018/19 is 1.1%. 43 

Given that productivity is inputs compared to outputs, a significant part of 

this more recent growth was due to a slower rise in inputs. Between 2004/05 

and 2018/19, inputs grew at a lower rate than outputs, but this was reversed 

in 2019/20 and 2020/21. This is partly because the most valuable \(or high 

cost\) output \(inpatient elective care primarily\), was stopped due to the 

pandemic. 

**Healthcare productivity compared to the wider economy **

According to ONS figures, healthcare productivity growth was higher than 

across the wider UK economy prior to the pandemic. This was partly a result 

of reduced infrastructure and capital spending, and wage restraint. 44 

The wider economy did not see a similar fall in productivity during the 

pandemic, so despite bigger increases since then, healthcare productivity 

remains lower than the wider economy. 

Healthcare was, however, the biggest contributor to public sector 

productivity growth in 2022. 45

**Explaining current trends? **

4.1 

What does NHS England say about lower 

productivity compared to 2019? 

NHS England \(NHSE\) have said key factors that explain what happened to productivity during and since the pandemic include: 

• 

Reduced resilience. There was little spare capacity in the system 

prior to the pandemic due to real terms reductions in capital 

investment, a maintenance backlog and technology debt. 46 

• 

More complex patient needs means that those being admitted 

require longer hospital stays. 

• 

Longer hospital stays leading to reduced flow through urgent and 

emergency care pathways. 47 This is in part also due to lack of 

available social care and community health services. 

• 

Turnover of experienced leadership and management. 

• 

Staff burnout and lower engagement \(higher sickness rates with 

an increasing proportion of stress-related absence\). 48 

• 

In 2024, NHSE suggested that industrial action was partly responsible for poor productivity. 49 However, the IFS 

demonstrated rising hospital productivity in the first half of 2024, a period when doctors strikes were ongoing. 50 

4.2 

What does NHS England say about rising 

productivity since 2022? 

In its December 2024 update, NHS England \(NHSE\) reported rising activity in 

2023/24 compared to 2022/23. This includes elective appointments,

procedures and A&E attendances, which were above the 4% rise in NHS staff 

numbers. 

They reported this increase in productivity was due to: 

• 

An increase in elective procedures which resulted in same day discharge. 

• 

Reductions in agency spending. 

• 

Reductions in the length of stay for non-elective admissions. 51 

4.3 

What factors contributed to reduced 

productivity, according to stakeholders? 

Organisations and commentators writing about NHS productivity generally 

highlight there is no single reason for falling productivity during the pandemic 

and its slow recovery, and that it is likely to be the result of a number of 

factors. As noted above, low increases in expenditure may explain higher 

productivity levels between 2010 and the pandemic. 

**Lower levels of investment in the NHS pre-COVID-19 **

Between 2010 and the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of ‘inputs’ rose at lower 

levels than they had historically, which may have resulted in higher NHS 

productivity: 

**Staff pay **

In 2019, the Kings fund explained that the most significant driver of 

productivity growth was wage restraint since 2010. 52 They outlined how, by keeping wage growth lower than the number of people being cared for, the 

NHS was able to see more people per cost-of-each-staff-member. They 

predicted that, with wage restraint ending, this productivity trend may not 

continue. 

Conversely, recent pay agreements are higher than those agreed during the 

2010s and will have the opposite effect \(although these are adjusted for in 

ONS productivity measures\). 

**Capital infrastructure spending **

The IFS reports that whilst staff numbers have increased, there hasn’t been a 

commensurate increase in other hospital inputs. 53 This means that the number of doctors and nurses has increased more quickly than the number of 

hospital beds and scanners, making it more difficult for staff to do more. They

22 

Commons Library Research Briefing, 23 July 2025 

NHS productivity 



argue that this may partly explain the poor productivity in 2024 when 

compared to 2019. 

This lack of investment may have resulted in a lack of resilience in the 

healthcare system. 54 An argument made by many is that the UK was running the system ‘too hot’ prior to the pandemic, meaning there was insufficient 

capacity to absorb any shocks to the healthcare system. 55 Lower levels of capital investment in the UK may explain lower numbers of hospital beds 

compared with other countries \(among EU14 countries, only Sweden had 

fewer beds per 1000 population in 2019\) and lower numbers of diagnostic 

equipment \(the UK has the fifth lowest number of CT, PET and MRI scanners 

per capita in the OECD\). 56 

Capital spending also includes spending on digital infrastructure. A 2023 

report by the Health and Social Care Committee’s expert panel on digitising 

the NHS found that funding towards digitisation has not been sufficient, or 

has not been delivered, resulting in inadequate progress on building a digital 

infrastructure. 57 

A Public Accounts Committee report published in January 2025 found 

investment in technology has been slow since 2022 due to redirection of 

funding towards integrated care board’s spending deficits, despite 13% 

higher productivity levels in NHS providers that have implemented electronic 

patient records. 58 

**Staffing patterns **

There are more NHS staff who are new to the job compared to previous years. 

In 2018, 1 in 28 nurses or midwives were new registrants on the professional 

register; this increased to 1 in 14 by 2024. 42% of nurses and midwives who 

joined the NHS in 2023 were non-UK nationals, compared to 21% in 2018. This 

has resulted in a much younger NHS workforce, with lower experience levels 

either in healthcare, or in the UK healthcare system, and may also partly 

explain reduced productivity. 59 The Institute for Government describes changes in staffing patterns as staff churn, with increasing loss of 

experienced practitioners who are then replaced by less experienced junior 

staff, and falling proportions of staff staying in post, contributing to a 

reduction in institutional knowledge in the NHS. 60 

The King’s Fund identified that, after the publication of the 2013 Francis report 

on failures in care at Mid-Staffordshire Foundation NHS Trust, there was a 

recruitment drive. The resulting efforts to improve staff-to-patient ratios to

Commons Library Research Briefing, 23 July 2025 

NHS productivity 



improve patient safety may have been associated with a slowdown in 

productivity at the time. 61 

Despite this increase in staff numbers, productivity may also be hindered by 

ongoing vacancies. The vacancy rate in December 2022 was 8.9%, compared 

to 8.1% in December 2019, suggesting ongoing important gaps which are not 

being filled. 62 An NHS Providers survey of trust leaders found that whilst overall staff numbers have increased, there is a struggle to recruit people 

with key skills including radiographers, IT and administration staff, and 

nurses in bands 6-7. 63 

4.4 

Staff morale 

The IPPR argues that there is a link between poor productivity and low staff 

retention and morale. 64 In 2009, the NHS leaver rate was 9.5%. 65 Between 2010 and 2023, it has been an average of 11.2%. Staff surveys have found low 

staff satisfaction levels which are persistent despite pay agreements 

following industrial action, whilst professional surveys report that 45% of 

nurses, and 30% of doctors, were thinking of or planning to leave their 

respective professions in the UK. 66  

This is mirrored by an NHS Providers survey of Trust leaders in April/May 2023. 

When asked for the biggest challenges in returning to pre-COVID-19 

productivity levels, staff burnout and exhaustion was amongst the most cited 

reasons. 67 

An Institute for Government report based on interviews with clinicians and 

stakeholders suggested a psychological shift is likely causing lower 

‘discretionary effort’: 

Combined with battles over pay, and the burden of missed targets, this has left 

staff feeling exhausted and undervalued and so, we were told, less able – and 

willing – to engage in discretionary activity \(that is, to ‘go the extra mile’ at 

work\). 

There is a strong sense that, having given so much over the pandemic, staff 

have not been given the time and space to recover from the trauma. 68

Commons Library Research Briefing, 23 July 2025 

NHS productivity 



Authors at the Behavioural Insights Team69 who tracked quality adjusted metrics and staff survey outcomes suggested that, during the 2010s, 

increasing productivity was obtained through a 15% rise in reported unpaid 

overtime by staff. They argue that during COVID-19, when broader societal 

perspectives around work shifted, and more money and staff were made 

available, staff understood that “their sacrifices were avoidable collateral 

damage rather than dutiful necessity’’. This period was associated with the 

largest recorded decline in staff feeling valued \(in 2022/23\). 70 

4.5 

Patient complexity 

There has been an increase in long-term conditions amongst the general 

population, with a 6.1% annual increase in the number of patients with 2 or 

more health conditions between 2017 and 2022. 71 This has resulted in increasing complexity of care. Some suggest this has had an impact on 

productivity, with patients requiring more care for longer, and more complex 

interventions. NHSE cited this as a reason for reduced productivity, stating 

that patient complexity explains half or more of the increase in length of stay 

of emergency admissions. 72 

The Institute for Government and the Nuffield Trust agree that there is no firm 

evidence for this, though the Nuffield Trust did find an increase in the time 

health care assistants spent with patients between 2022 and 2023. 73 

4.6 

Organisational incentives 

There are different contractual routes through which providers of NHS 

services may be paid, and this may create incentives that influence 

productivity. 

Payment by results was a model rolled-out in 2004, changing hospital 

funding from block payment to activity-based payment. 74 However, there was an increase in the use of block-contracts after 2016, and payment by results

74 Under block contacts an annual fee is paid to the provider in return for access to a defined range of services, and may be based on the historical or expected spend of a particular service. Under payment by results \(sometimes also referred to as the ‘National Tariff’ payments\), providers are funded on the basis of the work they undertake. 



25 

Commons Library Research Briefing, 23 July 2025 

NHS productivity 



was suspended during COVID-19, with a reintroduction since then in elective 

care. 

The Darzi report argued that there was a connection between the lack of 

financial incentives associated with block contracts and the drop in clinical 

productivity metrics in urgent and emergency care \(which, unlike elective 

care, remain on block contracts\). The report argued that this had resulted in 

an environment where there are few incentives for teams to change how they 

work, since neither the organisation, nor the department, will be rewarded for 

doing so. The 10-year health plan published in July 2025 stated an intention to 

move away from block contracts to performance-based payment methods. 75 

4.7 

Patient flow 

The Darzi report notes that poor patient flow through hospitals is leading to 

activity not keeping pace with the increase in acute hospital staff and 

expenditure. 76 

In particular, the report found that 13% of NHS beds are occupied by people 

waiting for social care support or care in a more appropriate setting. This, 

they reported, creates a scenario where clinicians feel busy but are doing 

non-value adding work, as patients are not moving through the system. 

Changing demographics is likely to be contributing to this, with an 

increasingly older population more likely to require care in the community. 

The Darzi report links poor patient flow to a lack of capital funding and 

underinvestment in social care. An Institute for Government report also cites 

lack of available social care beds and a failure of integration between the 

NHS and social care. 77 

There are a range of complex factors that can influence the way patients flow 

through hospital and the wider health and care system, with unnecessary 

delays having a negative impact on productivity. These have been highlighted 

in work by the Royal Academy of Engineers. 78

**Proposed strategies to improve **

**productivity **

The complexity of healthcare productivity means there is no single answer for 

how it can be improved. Some interventions may be easier to measure, such 

as spending on capital and digital infrastructure. Others, however, such as 

‘agility’ and resilience are more difficult to define, measure and improve. 79 

5.1 

What has NHS England proposed? 

**Increasing digitisation **

NHS England \(NHSE\) stated a need to increase investment in IT systems for 

staff and patients in its productivity report in 2024, and cited digitisation as 

an explanation for increased productivity in its update in February 2025. 80 

This refers to basic technology as well as complex technological innovation, 

with an aim to free up staff time from chasing patient data or waiting for 

technology such as computers to start working. In oral evidence given to the 

Health and Social Care Committee in January 2025 by then NHSE chief 

executive, Amanda Pritchard, and NHSE chief financial officer Julian Kelly, 

they referred to technologies such as ambient documentation \(which uses 

large language models to record conversations and convert them to medical 

notes and discharge letters\), and virtual wards as being examples of 

technology which would increase productivity in the NHS. 81 Other examples cited by the NHS include the NHS App and the Federated Data platform. 82 

**Investment in NHS infrastructure **

NHSE reported 12,000 estate failures that have stopped clinical services over 

two years in 2022/23. They said in their May 2024 productivity report: 

A critical dependency of productivity improvement is modernisation of NHS 

facilities. 83

27 

Commons Library Research Briefing, 23 July 2025 

NHS productivity 



**Improving processes and pathways **

NHSE has launched a single shared NHS improvement approach, NHS IMPACT 

\(Improving Patient Care Together\). 84 This publishes clinical and operational improvement guides to improve patient flow through emergency care, 

improve theatre and peri-operative care and improve medical job planning to 

improve productivity. 

NHSE has committed to reducing unwarranted variation which reduces 

productivity by building organisational capacity to deliver improvement 

through systems like Getting it Right First Time. 85 

**Workforce engagement **

NHSE has implemented targeted programmes to increase staff retention by 

increasing opportunities for training and development, and encouraging 

more flexible working, with the stated aim of increasing productivity. 86 

**Prevention **

NHS England’s May 2024 productivity update states it aims to develop models 

which shift care upstream, and describes investing in preventative care as 

one of the “next steps” in its plan to improve productivity. This includes 

targeted secondary prevention, national prevention programmes such as 

those for diabetes, and digital weight management programmes. 87 The 10 

Year Health Plan \(published 3 July 2025\) also sets out how moving the focus of 

health services ‘from sickness to prevention’ is one of the government’s three 

shifts to transform the NHS. 

5.2 

Response to NHS England plans 

In its report on NHS financial stability published in January 2025, the Public 

Accounts Committee questioned whether NHS England \(NHSE\) would be able 

to deliver the annual productivity gains of 2.0% by 2028-29. 88 The committee recommended that NHSE set out in detail which specific actions and 

initiatives it expects to contribute to the increase in productivity it has 

committed to, and by how much. 

In its response to this report, the Department of Health and Social Care 

accepted this recommendation. They reported that NHSE are focused on 

increasing clinical and operational productivity in a number of ways, with 

every provider being sent a bespoke pack identifying productivity and

efficiency opportunities for 2025-26, with further plans for delivering 

productivity improvements from 2026-27 to be laid out after the Spending 

Review of June 2025. 89 

5.3 

What do stakeholders say will improve 

productivity? 

A number of organisations have published material on productivity. The 

Health Foundation established a ‘productivity commission’ in 2025 which aims 

to make recommendations on ‘how national policy levers….can be applied to 

drive productivity growth’. The commission aims to publish a full report in 

Autumn 2026. 90 

**Improving processes and pathways **

Improving the patient pathway and the processes to deliver patient care has 

been highlighted by the Health Foundation, the Darzi review, the Institute for 

Government and the National Audit Office as a key way to address productivity. There are number of ways this can be done: 

**Improve management capacity in the NHS **

Between 2009 and 2022, there was a 7.2% reduction in managers in the NHS, 

despite a rise in clinical staff. 91 This means that managers make up 1.9% of all staff, down from 2.6% in 2009. 92 In the overall economy, 11% of staff are employed in management roles. The IFS, Health Foundation and Institute for 

Government agree that the NHS is chronically undermanaged, and 

investment is required in effective management and leadership. 

This, they state, involves an increase in managerial capacity that is linked to 

increased autonomy. They argue that for managers to be effective, they need 

to be less constrained. This would involve managers having appropriate 

responsibility and autonomy, access to data analysis, and appropriate 

incentives. 93 

The Policy Exchange think tank echoed this. Their report suggested that there 

are too few incentives for managers which encourage innovation and 

calculated risk-taking. 94 They suggest acute care providers should have greater freedom to develop capital reserves and hire staff for operational 

roles that go beyond the ‘agenda for change’ banding system. 95 The 10-year 89 Government Response to the Committee of Public Accounts from Session 2024-25,  May 2025.

NHS productivity 



health plan has committed to introduce “new arrangements for senior 

managers’ pay to reward high performance and withhold pay increases for 

executive leadership teams who do not meet….expectations”. 96 

**Systems thinking **

Another way to improve processes in the healthcare system has been 

suggested by the Health Foundation. This involves using experts in systems 

thinking and engineers to design systems that can help to deal with 

complexity. 97 Using experts who can analyse the purpose and function of a system, and how it can be arranged, can make the system more productive. 

The Royal Academy of Engineers has used such methods to, for example, 

ensure the successful delivery of the 2012 Olympic games. They were also 

asked by the Department of Health and Social Care to examine challenges 

related to delayed discharges from hospital to community care in 2022. They 

were able to demonstrate the key challenges and opportunities for systems 

improvement to increase productivity. This is different to the system mapping 

skills which are usually found in healthcare and would require significant 

investment. 98 

Such approaches may reduce failure-demand according to the Health 

Foundation. 99 Failure-demand is demand for healthcare caused by not doing something properly in the first place, or failing to do something. For example, 

a mistake on a prescription that then necessitates another avoidable clinic 

review or leads to a hospital admission. Another example is performing 

unnecessary scans or sending unnecessary referrals. 

Related to both the systems approach and management capacity is the 

ability of health services to adapt and alter their ways of working. Professor 

Diane Coyle \(Bennet Professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge\) 

undertook interviews with those who worked at Addenbrookes Hospital and 

hospitals in Manchester to understand the changes in ways of working during 

COVID-19. 100 This highlighted how hospitals were allowed to quickly re-engineer processes to improve patient flow. The authors highlighted that 

changes were possible due to empowering staff to make decisions and 

reduced hierarchies. This was not maintained after COVID-19. 

**Reducing unnecessary variation **

This has been a focus of those attempting to improve productivity for some 

time. The Carter Report in 2015 made recommendations to reduce

Commons Library Research Briefing, 23 July 2025 

NHS productivity 



unwarranted variation. 101 More recently, Getting it Right First Time \(GIRFT\) is an example of an improvement programme which aims to improve quality 

and productivity by reducing unnecessary variation. Whilst it began as a 

programme to improve operating theatre productivity, it now spans across 

hospital and community services. For instance, they have worked with the 

Royal College of Physicians London to introduce new guidance on patient flow 

for patients admitted to hospitals as an emergency. 102 

This programme is clinically led and focuses primarily on quality and clinical 

effectiveness rather than productivity, engaging clinicians and frontline staff. 

This leads to productivity improvements as a result. However, Policy 

Exchange has reported significant variation in the uptake and utilisation of 

GIRFT’s theatre productivity programme, demonstrating that possible 

productivity gains may not be being taken advantage of. 103 

GIRFT may also reduce productivity as it is currently measured. For example, 

by reducing the number of appointments required by stroke patients, it has 

made the process more efficient. This may however translate as reduced 

productivity due to reduced activity. 

**Capital spending **

Stakeholders are widely in agreement that capital spending is required to 

improve productivity. The Health Foundation estimates that capital spending 

needs to increase by 10.2% annually between 2024/25 and 2029/30, and by 

5.4% thereafter, until 2034/35. 104 This is to compensate for reduced spending in the 2010s. It is also required to address the maintenance backlog and 

prevent productivity losses which may occur due to unsafe premises and 

faulty equipment. The Institute for Government \(IfG\) agrees and suggests 

protecting capital spending to avoid it being rediverted towards day-to-day 

spending. 

Daine Coyle uses the analogy of giving a construction site worker a 

mechanical digger instead of a spade to demonstrate how investment in 

capital will improve labour productivity. She suggests that capital spending in 

healthcare should be considered as part of national infrastructure. This 

means investing in the resilience of the system and building enough capacity, 

without running an overly lean system, allowing it to absorb shocks. 105

**Digital Technology **

Digital technology is often cited as a route to productivity gains and is one of 

the three big shifts promised by the 10 Year Health Plan. 

While the focus is often on the adoption of AI and other technological 

innovation, basic digital technology investment has been suggested as an 

important first step. Some hospitals are still using paper notes for patients 

and fax machines, whilst in January of 2025, only 75% of CQC-registered adult 

social care providers had a digital social care record. 106 

The Health Foundation describes digitisation as reliant on putting in place 

foundations including electronic patient records, digital social care records, 

interoperable hardware and software systems, and cloud storage. 107 

This will require investment both in procurement and implementation. 

Working with PA consulting, a 2025 report by the Health Foundation 

estimated that the NHS and adult social care providers would require the 

following funding for the building blocks of digitisation: 

• 

£8bn of capital investment \(£5bn for England alone\) over the next 

5 years to put in place the required digital infrastructure. 

• 

A further £3bn of revenue funding for the initial day-to-day 

running costs. 

• 

An additional £2bn in recurring annual investment. 108 

The acquisition of technology will not on its own drive productivity according 

to multiple stakeholders. Professor Diane Coyle cites previous experiences of 

using digital technology in the NHS as a cautionary tale, to avoid over-

emphasising the productivity gains which may be made because of digital 

investment. Her work demonstrated that even in the private sector, only 5% 

of firms have been able to improve productivity, suggesting that only those on 

the ‘productivity frontier’ are able to effectively use digital tools. 109 

Separate work by the Health Foundation found that 44% of studies into 

electronic patient records show that there was either a negative or no impact 

on staff time availability, with implementation often a barrier to effective use 

of technology. 110 

In the NHS, when surveyed for the Darzi report, staff had a strong perception 

that information technology created an additional burden. This has led

authors at the Health Foundation to argue that the government must “fund 

the change, not just the tech”. 111 

**What kind of digital technology will impact productivity? **

Health Foundation experts have noted that debates about how technology 

will affect the future of healthcare often default to cutting-edge clinical tech. 

However, they note the importance of technologies to support administrative 

and operational work. A Health Foundation survey of clinical staff in 2024 

highlighted the most highly valued technologies were those supporting 

administrative work \(most prominently, electronic health records, EHRs\) and 

communications \(digital messaging tools and videoconferencing\). 112 Along with clinical documentation tools, EHRs were also picked as one of the top 

two technologies with the greatest potential to save time within the next five 

years. 

Administrative technologies offer significant opportunities for a number of 

reasons. Unlike clinical tasks, administrative tasks \(particularly those 

involving routine information processing\) are more amenable to automation. 

They also tend to have wide application across the NHS workforce, often 

helping with universal tasks such as note taking, communication or 

scheduling. They also tend to carry a lower level of the clinical risk, which can 

delay the implementation of clinical technology. 113 

Stakeholders have also suggested that technology investment should be 

focused on already existing technology, which is not well utilised in the NHS, 

rather than new technology which can drag policy attention away. 114 

**Incentive schemes **

The IFS have suggested that the Elective Recovery Fund and payment by results has spurred increasing productivity, particularly for elective 

operations, with more efficient use of hospital staff and hospital processes. 115 

Some have argued for a mixed system, part payment-by-results, part block 

funding, and part quality-based payments. The IfG argues however, that this 

is contingent on increased autonomy for NHS trusts, to allow them to build up 

surpluses to invest, and see tangible benefits of achievement. 116

NHS productivity 



**Build relationships and engage frontline staff **

Several organisations have argued that NHS leaders need to engage with 

staff, the public and patients, and change how they talk about, and 

understand, productivity. 117 The Health Foundation have noted that a financially driven focus on productivity should change to one which is quality 

driven. That means, particularly when addressing frontline staff, NHS leaders 

should talk about how processes and pathways can be changed to make 

things better for patients. This will be a more appealing way to engage staff, 

patients and the public in efforts to improve productivity, as it talks about the 

things that they care most about. 

Health Foundation analysis also highlights past programmes that focussed 

on financial improvements were not able to maintain productivity gains. They 

propose an approach which involves people with sophisticated engagement 

skills to engage front-line staff in spreading productivity and quality-related 

improvements across NHS organisations. They note the important thing about 

improvement approaches is that “first and foremost” they should be: 

…quality improvement agendas, driven and owned by front-line teams; as 

such they offer an opportunity to engage staff and to **harness the intrinsic, **

**vocational motivations of the workforce** more effectively than an 

economically framed agenda. 118 

A report by the Institute for Public Sector Productivity argues that low staff 

autonomy is a common theme in the NHS, which if addressed, would engage 

staff to increase productivity. 119 They make three recommendations: 

• 

NHS trusts should have a permanent team of improvement 

specialists with protected time to participate in schemes to 

transform clinical services. 

• 

NHS trusts should establish a staff board to represent ideas from 

the workforce and consult on matters that matter to staff. 

• 

Give staff a voice in setting the national workforce policy by 

including them in pay review body negotiations. 

The Nuffield Trust also argue that staff satisfaction should be a key 

consideration when considering how to tackle productivity. 120 They call for qualitative, in-depth research to understand the cultural perspective within 

NHS organisations. Such programmes are also championed by GIRFT. 

The Behavioural Insights Team also suggest placing workforce management 

at the heart of conversations about productivity. They give examples of self-

rostering systems for healthcare staff to build relationships between staff and 

managers to increase satisfaction and discretionary effort. 121 

**Increase focus on prevention **

In its submission to the 2025 Spending Review, the Health Foundation 

suggested an increase in public health spending back to 2015/16 levels per 

person. 122 They also suggested in this submission the creation of preventative departmental expenditure limits. This new category of government spending 

would be classified and ringfenced as investment for prevention, allowing 

policymakers to take a long-term view and provide a spending baseline which 

can be tracked to assess if prevention spending is going up or down. 

The Public Accounts Committees report on NHS financial sustainability 

recommended that NHSE and the Treasury define what counts as health 

prevention spending in order to track this on annual basis. 123 In its response to this report, the government stated it is considering the recommendation. 124 

Public health grants to local government fund prevention and health 

improvement programmes related to smoking, alcohol and drug use, weight 

management and other wider determinants of health. A number of 

organisations have highlighted, that despite recent increases, the total public 

health grant in 2025/26 is £3.86bn, 2% of the NHS budget. It has fallen 26% 

since 2015/16 in real terms per person. 125

**Regional and international comparisons **

Whilst there is a particular focus on improving NHS productivity amongst 

policy makers in England, there is some discussion of the issue in the devolved 

nations and outside of the UK. 

6.1 

Devolved nations 

The ONS estimates for health care productivity use data published by NHS 

England and the Department of Health and Social Care for England. For 

Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the devolved administrations submit 

unpublished data to the ONS but quality adjustment for outputs is only 

available for data from England. 

**Wales **

A performance and productivity review was commissioned by the Cabinet 

Secretary for Health and Social Care and reported in March 2025. This 

demonstrated that spending on workforce has exceeded growth in activity in 

Wales since 2020. This suggests falling workforce productivity. 126 

However, this review also found that there is no single national measurement 

of productivity in NHS Wales. It is therefore not possible to assess relative 

productivity. This report recommended the establishment of a national model 

to track productivity. 

The Welsh government, in its response, accepted the recommendation to 

develop a total factor productivity model to allow system-wide 

measurement. 127 

**Scotland **

In February 2024 the IFS produced a report on healthcare spending and 

productivity in Scotland. This found that NHS workforce productivity is 

broadly similar in England and Scotland. This is because Scotland saw a 

smaller rise in healthcare staff since COVID-19 compared to England, but has 

seen a larger relative reduction in elective admissions, emergency admissions 

and outpatient appointments. 128

NHS productivity 



**Northern Ireland **

The Nuffield Trust was commissioned to carry out a review of health and care 

productivity in Northern Ireland \(NI\) relative to the UK \(as well as funding, 

service performance and spending projections\) in 2022. 129 Findings from this review suggested lower productivity in NI, with the cost of hospital care 

having risen by 28% since 2016 compared to 7-8% in England. They also 

found a 25% higher spend on elective inpatient care compared what is spent 

for the same type of treatment in English hospitals and higher rates of 

patients who are admitted for longer periods. 

6.2 

International comparisons 

Due to differences in the way productivity statistics are compiled, as well as 

variations in the make-up and funding of healthcare systems, international 

comparisons are difficult to make. 

The Health Foundation commissioned the OECD to consider health system 

performance and the relationship between inputs and outputs amongst other 

healthcare systems in Europe. The OECD found that there is no indication that 

one group of health systems systematically outperform another. They 

concluded that these findings: 

reinforce the suggestion that large scale, “big bang” reforms, that require 

considerable political capital and financial resources are to be designed and 

implemented with caution, as just changing the whole system will not 

automatically improve performance. 

While no healthcare system consistently outperforms others in terms of 

productivity in this analysis, some countries with low levels of health spending 

as a share of GDP appear high on the efficiency score, in contrast to some 

historically well-funded health systems \(e.g. Germany\). The OECD note this 

result may be attributed to the declining marginal productivity observed in 

countries with high health expenditure as a share of GDP. They also note this 

supports long-standing OECD and IMF findings. Taken together, the OECD 

analysis states their findings “…support the idea that as inputs increase in 

health systems of major developed economies, outputs tend to increase too, 

but at a slower rate.” 130 

**Australia **

Similarly to the UK, Australia spent 10% of GDP on healthcare in 2021/22 \(up 

from 8% in 2000/01\). Given this rise, and further projected rises, the 

Australian productivity commission examined healthcare productivity in

2024. 131 This was the first Australian assessment which adjusted for quality, although in a much more limited way than is done in the UK. 

They were only able to assess quality adjusted productivity growth in a subset 

of diseases. This meant they examined only one third of healthcare by 

expenditure. They found that productivity grew by 3% between 2011/12 and 

2017/18, with quality improvements the biggest drivers of growth. 

This is higher than the UK productivity growth estimate over the same period, 

but it is not directly comparable as they only examined healthcare used to 

treat cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and blood, endocrine and kidney 

diseases. 

**Republic of Ireland **

The Minister of Health in the Republic of Ireland established a Department of 

Health productivity and savings taskforce in January 2024. 132 This is following a concern that despite a 20% increase in investment since 2020 in the 

publicly funded health system \(measured by acute hospital beds opened and 

staff hired\), there has been a ‘’divergence between resourcing and activity’’. 

Similar to the policy discussions of NHS productivity in the UK, this taskforce 

will examine the use of new technology and data management, operational 

processes, procurement and the future cost of healthcare.
