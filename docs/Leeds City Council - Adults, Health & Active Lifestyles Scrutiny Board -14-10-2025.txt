00:05:38.720 Hello I'm Shaa McFarland. the deputy director for adults and health lead city council.
00:05:44.880 Good afternoon everybody. I'm Caroline Barrier. I'm the director of adults and health at Lead City Council.
00:05:51.199 So welcome everyone. Thanks for coming today. I appreciate you taking a time out to come and speak to us. Um and with
00:05:57.759 that I'll pass over to Kate. So you can assume we've read the report but is there anything specific you want to draw
00:06:02.880 out? Please feel free to. Thank you. Um thank you. Um so it's been a year
00:06:08.720 since we have been to this committee to to discuss uh the approaches to collaborative workforce um in leads. Um
00:06:16.560 there have been some substantive policy shifts over the last 12 months. So I think a lot of our focus has been
00:06:21.919 understanding how they impact on leads and trying to predict and plan for some of the activities that we're going to
00:06:27.520 need to take over the coming years. not least the 10-year health plan for England um but also the substantive
00:06:34.000 changes in NHS England and uh the ICB as well which has created some uncertainty
00:06:40.000 I think it's fair to say across uh across the system um but what positives
00:06:45.600 in terms of leads is still a pivotal part of the health mission for the government and the work with the department of health and social care
00:06:52.240 based in quarry house means that we're in a in a good position to try and uh preempt some of those challenges and be
00:06:58.240 working with partners to try and work our way in how we translate that policy into practice that actually impact uh on
00:07:05.840 our local communities in a positive way. Um that's not to say there haven't been
00:07:11.919 substantial uh financial challenges and operational challenges across providers over the last year. Um and they are set
00:07:19.120 to continue in the current circumstances. Um and of course there is quite a lot of scrutiny um and rightly
00:07:25.039 so around the services that our providers are able to provide under that increasing pressure um from a financial
00:07:31.520 and operational perspective. Um the long-term indicators that we look
00:07:37.039 at collectively um mean that we've got a focus uh over that uh kind of 5 to 10
00:07:42.639 year horizon. Um unfortunately we haven't had much clarity around apprenticeships over the next uh 5 to 10
00:07:49.520 years. We were waiting for some um some policy changes around that and obviously in leads apprenticeships have been a big
00:07:55.599 part of our uh approach to bringing employment um into uh the health and
00:08:00.639 social care sector. Um however you'll see from the indicators that numbers and
00:08:06.080 engagement in apprenticeships has remained stable which I think is a a positive at at the moment. Um and
00:08:12.000 there's been a substantive increase in collaborative learning and reach across uh different partners beyond statutory
00:08:17.919 partners into primary care, community care, um VCSE organizations who are all
00:08:23.280 contributing um to health and social care workforce. So I I've said in the paper around the
00:08:29.919 levels of risk um I think when you look at the aggregate position um our health and care workforce in the city is
00:08:35.760 reasonably stable. That's not to say it's all positive. There are definitely pressures in terms of capacity. Um and
00:08:42.320 there are peaks and troughs when you look at individual providers and services in the city. Um we know that
00:08:47.760 there are um pockets of higher turnover particularly relating to contract insecurity
00:08:53.760 um in various areas. Um and there are still well-being challenges which are leading to um high levels of absence uh
00:09:00.480 in some some services as well. Um but you'll see from there um the last annual
00:09:06.800 review that there's been a lot of um collaborative interventions to try and support our workforce through that um
00:09:13.279 through those challenges. Um, particularly want to highlight the work with children and young people because
00:09:19.040 that's been a significant focus for this last year and has been made some real great impact particularly in community
00:09:25.120 centers and schools um engaging with over 6,000 um children and young people
00:09:30.320 over the last year uh to to look at um how uh potential future careers in
00:09:36.080 health and social care linked their current health and well-being and that of their families. Um which is really
00:09:41.120 great. Um and I also want to highlight the um health and growth accelerator work which is part of the government's
00:09:48.000 um national initiatives that West Yorkshire is part of. Um and the work in leads has been particularly focused
00:09:54.000 around thriving at work and helping people who are potentially um at risk of
00:09:59.120 becoming economically inactive i.e. leaving the health and social care workforce uh altogether.
00:10:05.519 um how we help them stay and thrive in work and that um is showing some really positive um outcomes both in terms of
00:10:12.640 numbers of engagement and outcomes but also the people's um experiences and
00:10:17.839 human stories that are coming through that work. Um so looking to the future I
00:10:23.200 think there's a a really clear focus um from the uh 10-year health plan around the integrated neighborhood health. Um
00:10:30.160 and as I said leads is very well positioned to be part of that. Um and from a workforce perspective, we've got
00:10:35.680 a good uh partnership established um to try and drive that work forward uh in the interests of um residents of Leeds.
00:10:43.839 Um and we are taking a long-term view of that uh despite short-term project funding. So we have the infrastructure
00:10:50.880 through the academy and the established partnership which means that we're able to build on that work uh year on year
00:10:56.640 and adapt it into what we do for business as usual. So I'll stop there
00:11:01.680 but happy to take questions. Thank you very much. Um so members if
00:11:07.279 you want to ask questions indicate in the usual way. Um just to get started I've just got a couple of initial questions. So one is around um has there
00:11:14.720 been any sort of change in your strategy around um the the idea of shifting from
00:11:20.800 uh to prevention. So has that been is that different skills or is there something you need to change in that?
00:11:26.240 And then the second question in terms of um terms of vacancies and bank and locoms have we been able to see any do
00:11:34.240 we have any data on um whether that's uh reducing? Thank you.
00:11:41.680 Um yes so I can certainly take the first question um around prevention. So I
00:11:46.880 think that's been a an ongoing trend over the last few years. there's been a clear strategic um imperative to try and
00:11:53.600 um develop skills in that prevention agenda. Um I would say probably over the last two years or so there's been much
00:12:00.480 um greater uh partnership working around the public health space um and that prevention work that's then feeding
00:12:07.360 through into the broader health and social care workforce. Um obviously the role of VCSE is really important in that
00:12:13.440 as well because of their links in with communities and their um ability to work with communities and individuals to um
00:12:20.959 uh approach some of those health promotion aspects as well. Um so we're
00:12:26.160 seeing some um really positive uh increases through the training that's available for health and social care
00:12:32.320 workforce and since we have started that expansion program we've seen a a big uptake in the um training of skills and
00:12:39.920 knowledge around um prevention but still a lot more to do um in relation to the
00:12:46.800 agency. Um I'll ask Darren to come in in a moment from from an NHS provider perspective.
00:12:52.560 um we don't have any um issues in terms of actually filling vacancies generally.
00:12:58.160 So we can either fill them through bank or through agency. So the skills pool is out there generally for the services
00:13:04.160 that we need. Um I think there's been a very clear direction to try and reduce cost in relation to using agency. Um and
00:13:11.600 obviously um one of the ways in doing that is encouraging people to join um organizational bank. Um so we're trying
00:13:18.720 to track and understand the implications of that. a lot of the people who are on our organizational banks are also
00:13:26.000 employed elsewhere in the system. So, it's not usually a standalone contract. Um, but yeah, there's still a pressure
00:13:33.040 through agency spend, but I'll ask Darren to come in a little bit more from an NHS perspective.
00:13:39.360 Uh, yes. So um in terms of the NHS and I can only speak for my organization we
00:13:45.440 have seen a significant reduction in the usage of uh agency and bank us and an
00:13:52.560 increase in bank usage. So there is a a directive from NHS England for all NHS
00:13:57.920 organizations to reduce their agency uh usage by 30% and their bank usage by
00:14:04.560 10%. Um, as an organization, we've been really successful in transferring a lot
00:14:10.000 of our agency workers onto our internal bank. Um, which provides significantly
00:14:15.760 more benefits for them. Um, however, that's caused the increase in the usage of
00:14:22.320 bank. Um, so we we are undertaking a significant piece of work on how we can
00:14:27.519 uh reduce uh our our usage of of bank nursing. And actually um we've got a
00:14:34.480 significant program particularly around healthcare support workers of uh transitioning them into substantive
00:14:40.399 employment. Uh so that's been quite successful. Yeah, super thanks for that. I just
00:14:46.560 think there's something about getting um people through the qualifications and into permanent contracts which almost
00:14:52.240 certainly cheaper than even the bank stuff. Great. Thank you. Okay, I'm going to bring in Jonathan.
00:15:00.000 Thank you, chair. Um I just wanted to explore a bit. Uh on page 21
00:15:07.600 um there's a diagram that shows the health and care workforce profile where
00:15:13.600 roughly a third of the workforce is adult social care. But when you look on
00:15:18.959 page 24 at um the takeup workforce engaged in
00:15:25.360 academ academy learning etc. it seems the proportion of involved in social care is
00:15:33.120 much much smaller and I wonder if you could explain that because in a way it
00:15:38.399 sort of feels like it's mainly health and only a little bit social care.
00:15:45.680 Um yes so this is an ongoing trend and something that we're we're trying to work on collaboratively. I think the the
00:15:51.839 key issue is that um obviously through our social care employers there are hu hundreds of different social care
00:15:58.720 employers that employ very small numbers of staff. Um so in terms of engagement
00:16:04.160 and being able to release those staff to participate in training even to access online training being aware of these
00:16:10.959 particular um offers that are able open to them um is a bit of a challenge to be
00:16:16.000 honest. So we work through our um social care networks in the system. Um Caroline
00:16:22.399 and her team are obviously instrumental from a council perspective in engaging with the independent social care
00:16:27.759 employers. Um we work with leads care association and skills for care to try
00:16:32.880 and um really promote access to this training and encourage uptake. But we
00:16:38.160 are aware of some of the real challenges of um both awareness of of people being able to access it and the practical
00:16:45.040 practicalities of people taking time out of working in independent care organizations to participate
00:16:51.680 particularly in the face-to-face training which is a challenge. So yeah, it's something that we we're determined
00:16:57.199 to increase but that that's the explanation of it.
00:17:03.120 Thank you. Have you got a separate followup then? Great. Thank you, Councelor Richie.
00:17:09.520 Thank you, Chair, and thank you for the report. Um, I've got a few things. Um, first of all, on page 18, it mentions
00:17:16.079 staff morale is relatively stable. Could you just um give us some indication how
00:17:22.000 you've um got that information together? Because I'm certainly conscious that
00:17:28.480 sure we all are. as um cuts start to bite, people are being asked to do more
00:17:34.880 more pressures on people. Perhaps their terms and conditions might be at risk.
00:17:40.400 Um which generally undermine staff morale. So I'd be interested in what evidence you've got to reassure us of
00:17:48.320 that fact that you state there. My second question is around there's a
00:17:54.480 reference to the new visa legislation. Now my understanding is the government
00:18:00.080 have raised the salary threshold uh which in an ideal world that our care
00:18:05.679 workers would be receiving that salary but that's unlikely to happen in the short term. So could you just expand on
00:18:12.799 how you think that will impact um recruitment going forwards?
00:18:19.039 And then the final thing um councelor Scopes mentioned uh banks um obviously
00:18:25.440 to reduce agency costs obviously the you mentioned the NHS have their own bank
00:18:32.000 and some other third sector organizations large ones have have their own internal banks. Is there any
00:18:38.799 workaround or scope for a sort of citywide bank so that smaller providers
00:18:43.840 may be able to utilize staff uh from uh you know a bank citywide bank to reduce
00:18:52.480 their own costs on agency. Thank you.
00:18:58.000 Um yeah thank you. So I'll start with the the morale question. Um I think this is a really kind of broad indicator. So
00:19:05.039 I would say there's absolutely pockets in the system where there is um much more um kind of tension and uh different
00:19:12.480 trends in terms of morale. Um the indicators we use are usually through staff surveys. So they're usually taken
00:19:19.280 at one point in time during the year. So are not necessarily um particularly susceptible to fluctuations that have
00:19:26.160 been immediate. Um and of course we're talking about um views across the kind of 60,000 wide workforce. Um what we're
00:19:34.480 looking at um from a city perspective is if there's any kind of significant trends in that that we can track since
00:19:40.880 the last uh time we we assessed it and we take professional insights from the HR director um kind of
00:19:49.360 colleagues across the city. Um so and and what I would say is that the morale
00:19:54.559 in the workforce hasn't been high for a long time. So whilst I say it's stable in this report, it's not necessarily
00:20:01.440 high and stable. It is just not there's nothing significantly disruptive um around it at the moment. I think we are
00:20:08.559 expecting it to to be even more challenged over the next year or so. So we're seeing that kind of uncertainty
00:20:15.280 particularly in uh contractual situations and the pressures. Um so you
00:20:20.559 know we expect that that will flow through to to morale but we are trying collectively and as individual employers
00:20:27.919 to to tackle that. Um the the point around visas I I'll
00:20:33.120 bring Caroline in in a moment. She might she may have a a perspective on this. the um I think the it very complex in
00:20:41.120 terms of how we um how we manage that collectively in the city because as I mentioned before lots of the people
00:20:47.039 affected are individual independent employers and looking at how um that impacts on their specific workforce uh
00:20:53.600 is quite different. Um I think the um the challenges around um fair pay and
00:21:00.480 all of the associated uh aspects of that is something that in leads we've been really really kind of prioritizing for
00:21:06.320 some time now and we've been involved in the West Yorkshire um fair work charter and trying to drive that through the
00:21:12.080 health and social care sector um and the work with the health and growth accelerator as well to really understand
00:21:18.240 that value of um good work not just any work but good employment and the impact
00:21:23.280 on health and vice versa. So I think the the work that will help shore up the risks around the visas is
00:21:30.720 carrying on anyway. But I think there is absolutely a gap and we we will see and we are seeing some of the challenges of
00:21:37.120 the visa regulations and the the thresholds changing um creating some real pressures in the system. Caroline,
00:21:43.679 I don't know if you want to come in. Uh thank you very much. Um yes um we are
00:21:50.240 anticipating and we're already hearing from some providers particularly uh
00:21:55.280 residential and nursing care providers saying that they're worried about the the changes um and the impact in that
00:22:02.799 they will not be able to go uh overseas to overseas recruitment in the way that they have done for the last couple of
00:22:09.440 years where it has really eased pressure around workforce capacity. Um this is
00:22:16.240 always not always um sort of you know one side to this. There's another side of this as well. Um what we have seen um
00:22:24.720 for home care particularly is um quite a lot of um adverse impact of the
00:22:32.080 international recruitment where we've seen so many displaced workers. So they've been brought in by the less
00:22:39.280 scrupulous of providers. uh they've been brought in with the promise of sufficient work uh enough hours of work
00:22:47.440 per per week um uh uh which then allows
00:22:52.559 them to meet their visa conditions uh but then that work hasn't been made available and so we've we've had um
00:23:00.159 thousands in the region of displaced workers in Yorkshire and Humber um we
00:23:05.840 are working with providers um with other providers the the the the more um you
00:23:12.159 know high caliber providers to try and find alternatives for these displaced um
00:23:18.960 uh members of staff. So it it's almost a sort of you know there is a real negative impact as a result of the
00:23:26.559 changes in the visa rules but equally there's a little bit of um uh sort of uh
00:23:32.480 opportunity to make sure that we're securing and matching those displaced
00:23:38.640 workers where there might well be vacancies in other areas. So we're balancing that. Um longer term to be
00:23:45.760 quite honest we don't know the impact. Uh obviously we're expecting changes to happen as a result of the FA fair pay
00:23:53.120 agreement which hopefully uh when it comes into effect in 2028 will really
00:23:59.679 help with um us being able to source enough workforce capacity um within uh
00:24:07.280 locally and with within the this country. But of course that in itself is
00:24:12.480 challenging because we need to make sure that there will be appropriate levels of funding which we can then pass on to
00:24:18.880 providers to pay their staff um you know above uh national living wage. So uh all
00:24:25.520 of these things come with complexity but hopefully um working towards a positive
00:24:31.279 outcome going forward but it's challenging without a doubt it's challenging.
00:24:39.360 Um and then yeah just just to pick up on the last question around the bank. So um it's a it's a consideration that we've
00:24:46.320 discussed uh previously in the city around whether there's an opportunity to to collaborate more around a kind of
00:24:52.480 citywide bank. Um and certainly we've been looking at what some of what other places are doing to try and tackle this.
00:24:59.520 Um I think to there's a lot of complexity in it and risk which you know
00:25:05.760 in a stable environment is um one thing but in the current um environment is quite challenging to work through from a
00:25:12.559 an organizational accountability perspective. Um so there's a lot of issues around indemnity and risk and and
00:25:19.039 as I mentioned before what we understand about our workforce is that the majority of people who work on the bank um in in
00:25:26.080 current form are already employed in the system. Um so the approach we decided to
00:25:31.360 take was the staff portability agreement. So we set up uh a couple of years ago now a framework which allows
00:25:38.799 organizations to deploy staff into other organizations for short periods of time
00:25:44.240 to to manage emergency or workforce pressures uh service pressures. Um where
00:25:50.640 it is used it's used very successfully. I think in the report it references that there is quite limited take up of it. So
00:25:57.120 I think there's a piece of work for us to review why that is not being used more widely and what some of the
00:26:02.799 challenges are about um the pace of being able to deploy somebody in a situation where you need somebody
00:26:09.120 quickly and the automatic go-to um responses I think for many private organizations is sadly agency because
00:26:16.880 that's their that's where their relation relationships lie. So I think there's a bit of work to do to understand um what
00:26:23.120 what the options are, what the barriers are. Um but we do have some mechanisms in leads which will help that.
00:26:32.480 Super. Thank you very much. Okay, I'm going to bring in councelor Gibson next.
00:26:40.480 Thanks chair. Uh I think you've you've sort of answered um the question I was going to
00:26:46.799 ask a question around morale. Um obviously a lot of change I mean
00:26:52.159 there's been you know significant pay increases across the board per inflation
00:26:57.360 beating pay increases over the past couple of years. Um you know we we hear
00:27:02.400 that waiting lists have come down on obviously not the past three months and productivity up. So I would have expected morale in some quarters to to
00:27:10.880 have improved but then again you know with the NHS England reorganization and and strikes looming as well. So is it
00:27:16.559 the case when you say it's stable that sort of some parts are happier than than they were and then other parts are less happy and it's sort of a movable feast
00:27:23.279 and that maybe you could confirm or deny that. Um so I read this today which um
00:27:31.279 in in the Guardian which absolutely absolutely shocked me and I wondered whether it's something that that we're
00:27:37.840 having to to deal with in in leads. Uh I apologize to people because it is a shocking headline. uh terrible, but I'm
00:27:44.559 going to read it out anyway because um it's probably the grim reality of of what's happening on the ground for some people. So, the Guardian headlined was
00:27:51.360 frightened to get out of their cars. Britain's toxic race debates threaten overseas care workers. Um, and the
00:27:57.919 report, the article goes into into detail about how some pe some care
00:28:03.440 workers are being advised to to go into twos and to not have two um, black or or
00:28:09.520 or Asian or overseas care workers together and always pair up with, I
00:28:15.200 guess, somebody from from the UK. Um, are things that bad? Are we experiencing
00:28:20.240 that in leads? is this, you know, I'm not going to get into the politics of it, but you know, and how are we
00:28:25.600 supporting staff through this if they're, you know, these are the these are the people that are looking after our most vulnerable and and vulnerable
00:28:32.399 citizens and are doing a wonderful job job that um is absolutely backbreaking and incredibly skilled and difficult and
00:28:38.799 they're having to deal with this on a on a daily basis. I mean, what on earth's going on and how we're supporting them?
00:28:46.320 Thank you very much. Thank you, Councelor Gibson. Um we absolutely share those concerns. Um this isn't new uh to
00:28:54.480 be honest. Uh we know that from our care providers but again particularly home
00:29:00.159 care providers. Um and I'll just talk about social care. I mean there will be
00:29:05.520 the same I'm sure in uh the NHS as well but we know from our home care providers
00:29:12.000 that um you know uh many of their care workers have been turned away by people
00:29:18.880 and said no I don't want you to come and uh undertake you know come into my home
00:29:23.919 or take personal care. Um and so this is something that our home care providers have been working with for a long long
00:29:30.720 time. You know, if we go back 10, 15, 20 years ago, many people were saying, "No,
00:29:36.000 I don't want male carer coming in. I only want female carers." So, um, our
00:29:41.279 our care providers are quite used to people turning people away. Um we have a
00:29:47.760 very clear position that you know um if it's reasonable request uh um then uh in
00:29:55.760 terms of you know um language barrier or difficulty understanding a care worker then we will
00:30:03.600 make sure that the provider does organize rotors so that um uh you know
00:30:09.360 if it's double up etc uh appropriate staff can go in particularly to meet the
00:30:14.960 communication needs. needs of the individual. And it could go the other way as well. It could be, you know, an ethnically diverse person requiring a
00:30:21.760 service and a white carer going in and not understanding each other. So really having those sensitivities is really
00:30:28.000 important. The the more recent um uh concerns
00:30:33.840 around the um care workers going in areas where they think they might experience racial abuse uh and
00:30:41.840 discrimination. We we very clearly say zero tolerance around uh racial abuse
00:30:48.399 and we will stand by providers and their care workers if they say we can't deliver a service to this individual
00:30:55.679 because they're being um uh abusive. And it doesn't matter if it's to a white
00:31:02.000 member of staff or if it's a member of staff of ethnically diverse background. We will not tolerate racial
00:31:08.720 discrimination in any way. um you know it could be Polish, it could be Ukrainian, it could be anybody um
00:31:16.559 experiencing that and that is just not acceptable. And and our social work staff will in turn um and our
00:31:24.000 commissioning staff, contracting staff will in turn talk to the individuals and their families to say if you want this
00:31:30.240 care you know you've got to make sure that um you you know you're not getting
00:31:35.520 you know the care workers are not getting abused. in terms of wider community people going and driving in
00:31:42.799 areas. So, not necessarily the experience that they get when they go into an individual's home and and the
00:31:49.039 person receiving the care. But if it's the wider community, um again, you know, we've got to make sure that um providers
00:31:57.279 do um uh uh pro u provide security for
00:32:03.360 their care workers so that they do take into consideration and they don't place their care workers in um um potentially
00:32:11.919 difficult situations. So the pairing up um having um access to uh phone and
00:32:19.919 being able to be on call because we're talking about evenings, we're talking about weekends when you know there might
00:32:25.519 not be office staff available. So having an overall well-being and support offer
00:32:31.919 to any care workers and if care workers are saying I'm really frightened to go in that area then that their wishes
00:32:38.240 should be uh absolutely um uh u taken into consideration.
00:32:43.600 Fortunately at this point we haven't had um home care providers coming to us
00:32:49.840 saying that their care workers are scared about going into particular areas in more recent times. We do and we will
00:32:57.519 continue to check in with providers to say we need to know if this becomes an issue, but we haven't heard that so far.
00:33:08.960 Um, I'm going to bring in Darren, do you want to come in? And then I'm going to bring in councelor Venna. Um, but I do
00:33:15.600 think that's it's a shocking shocking situation. It sounds like the it's less
00:33:22.960 bad in Leads, but it's still deeply worrying. elect um Darren and councelor Venant
00:33:28.640 come in. Yes, thank you. Um sadly we're we're hearing those stories within our own
00:33:36.000 organization. Um and it's where um our colleagues from the global majority are
00:33:42.640 going about their day-to-day business in their their normal life and they're bringing some of their experiences into
00:33:48.720 work which is quite um we've heard some really distressing stories. So we are actually uh we've put on a number of
00:33:54.960 what we've called listening sessions to enable people to come to us and tell us what their experiences are um and
00:34:01.200 working with them in order to um try and overcome and prevent some of the issues
00:34:06.320 that they are seeing on a day-to-day basis. Um but yeah sadly those those headlines are real.
00:34:15.599 Thank you. I wanted to follow on from this point as well. So, um, on the health well-being board, we've been
00:34:22.320 talking for quite a long time about the abuse of staff in health and care settings, and we've done some really
00:34:28.320 specific workshops just looking at that issue, like what staff are facing, how
00:34:34.399 we protect them, how we um, support them in, you know, in increasingly
00:34:41.040 challenging work environments. Where that came from was um I'm a governor at
00:34:46.320 um LY PFT and I was quite shocked a couple of years ago by the percentage of
00:34:52.800 staff that had faced abuse from patients or their families or the community. But
00:34:58.320 I don't think that's a specific LPFT thing. We know as counselors we live in
00:35:03.440 an increasingly intolerant society. you know the the amount of abuse we get has increased you know
00:35:10.640 since co since you know the cost of living crisis it feels like a lot of people are at the end of their tether
00:35:16.560 and are increasingly offensive and anyone in a public facing role um so
00:35:24.640 that's where kind of I started sort of wanting us to look at this as a health and wellbeing board and then following
00:35:31.680 the um disturbances last summer in Leeds and then the riots elsewhere where in the
00:35:37.280 country we looked at this specific on the health and wellbeing board because of the impact on people of what was
00:35:44.480 happening and the beginning of the kind of rice rise in racism and far-right
00:35:49.599 activity that we're seeing now and one of the things that I think is a challenge in care environments
00:35:57.680 is people's right to care even if they're really offensive so um this is a
00:36:03.760 bit of an extreme example and obviously this doesn't apply at all to everyone who's under the care of the mental
00:36:10.400 health act, but staff working in wards um with people who are sectioned under
00:36:16.880 the mental health act can't not work with them if they're offensive. Um well,
00:36:22.560 individuals can. I think that's that's the point. like people have a right to care and may in that circumstance be
00:36:29.520 being offensive because they don't want to be there and or because they're unwell but still need to be cared for.
00:36:36.400 So in that circumstance, it's very much about how how we respond as employers across the city, how we support staff
00:36:42.640 that are particularly affected. Um as Darren said, particularly staff from the global majority, how teams, you know,
00:36:50.400 configure their work so that staff that are particularly affected are not consistently on the receiving end of
00:36:56.240 abusive interactions from people. Um the police also their um hate crime
00:37:02.960 coordinator who's called Marine Sergeant Marine something I can't remember her second name. She's done some specific
00:37:08.640 work about hate crime in the NHS where she's actually gone on towards and worked with staff where people are under
00:37:16.160 the care of the NHS but actually you know behaving in a hateful way. So I I
00:37:22.560 do think it's a particular challenge for staff working in caring environments because people have a have a if someone
00:37:29.040 has a need for care, they have a need for care. Um but it's about how we support those staff and um you know
00:37:36.800 ensure that they're not on the receiving end of abuse as part of their daily work. But it is an ongoing challenge.
00:37:43.839 But it's an ongoing challenge. We're really alive to on the health and wellbeing build at that strategic senior level. After last summer with the riots,
00:37:51.359 we had a session where a representative from all the organizations, so like children's social care, adult social
00:37:56.560 care, um, LTH, LYPT, and LCH, they all gave a summary of what they're doing to
00:38:01.920 support staff um because it felt really important that we look at we know some staff are particularly affected by
00:38:08.480 what's happening and what are we doing to support them in their work because in any public facing role, of course, the
00:38:14.079 OHS or social care is a microcosm of society. So if there's racism in society, it's going to be in our
00:38:20.160 organizations and we have a duty as employers to look at how we support people working in those settings. Thank
00:38:26.960 you. Thank you for those comments, councelor Benner. Okay, I'm going to bring in councelor France May.
00:38:35.760 Thank Thank you, Chess. Thank you, chair. I just um want to go
00:38:42.640 back to NHS staff morale. Um staff and morale would be quite poor if policies
00:38:50.640 are used to weaponize against staff to coers staff to do um to change their
00:38:59.040 annual leave or to do certain roles that's not part of their job that's not
00:39:04.160 part of their job description. So what what are you doing to tackle that?
00:39:11.359 Um so that staff members um are able to go to work and feel that
00:39:17.920 you know what we enjoy at the work that we do without being pressurized or coerced doing something that we don't
00:39:24.400 want to do. Um and I also want to say um thank you for using the correct term
00:39:30.720 global majority as well. It's good to hear it. It's been going around for nearly 10 years and for some strange
00:39:37.760 reason we're not using it. Um I worked at the um NHS
00:39:43.280 about 25 years ago. I know one of my colleagues was a nurse many many years. No I shouldn't have said that
00:39:49.760 said that at all. And um people were refusing help then because of the color
00:39:55.760 of your skin. Um but I'm I'm I'm concerned about the morale and the
00:40:01.200 coercive um persuasion and the weaponizing of NHS policies against
00:40:07.359 staff members.
00:40:13.359 So thank you for your question. Um in terms of my organization, I'm not aware of any of our policies being used as as
00:40:19.520 a weapon. However, we have got very robust uh grievance procedures um which
00:40:24.640 our staff uh use on a regular basis. But that particular issue has never been
00:40:31.040 raised in in my organization. Um but we have numbers of uh listening sessions.
00:40:37.839 We have a number of staff networks where um I'm more than happy to go back and and raise that with with people to see
00:40:45.040 if there is a problem. Um in terms of staff morale, uh Kate was right. We have
00:40:50.560 an annual staff survey which is probably um the biggest global staff survey um
00:40:56.640 that there is uh in the NHS and it is currently running right at this moment.
00:41:01.920 So it launched at the beginning of October. um and we use that as a barometer. Um
00:41:07.839 but sadly it's a once a year uh process but we do do what we call regular pulse
00:41:13.680 surveys throughout the year although there's very little uptake of those uh surveys sadly. Um but the other way we
00:41:21.680 uh test and um morale within the organization is through our staff
00:41:27.760 networks listening to our staff and what they're telling us and we are quite responsive where we can be. Um there are
00:41:34.480 a number of issues that we are still working on and there's a lot to do. Um but it's something we are constantly
00:41:41.839 aware of because it's uh we need to keep our staff. So retention is very key in the NHS at the moment and we're doing a
00:41:48.960 significant amount of work around retention.
00:41:55.359 Um yeah, so if I could come in on that point as well because I think you you raised a really valid point. Um, and
00:42:01.520 it's not restricted to the NHS either. It it definitely applies across uh across all employers. And I think one of
00:42:08.079 the big challenges we see at the moment is this tension between the drive for productivity and trying to get the best
00:42:14.240 out of very finite resources for the the benefits of the patients and service
00:42:19.359 users and making sure that the staff are well looked after, supported and
00:42:24.480 thriving at work. And I think some of the collaborative interventions that we do across leads are really powerful in
00:42:30.640 actually challenging some of the perceptions and misconceptions perhaps about that tension and how that plays
00:42:36.400 out in the real world. Um, so we've had some really great examples of where smaller organizations can be much more
00:42:43.520 flexible, for example, in terms of their contracts, the ways hours of working,
00:42:48.720 um, you know, things like that, but they're perhaps not as good at providing some of the health and well-being
00:42:54.480 additional employee assistance programs. So it's about how do we bring the best of each different employer from their
00:43:02.160 different setting together and try and open up that access and share that learning across the employers so that
00:43:08.079 they can actually come together and try and improve things from from the different perspectives. Um, one of the
00:43:13.920 things we've seen around the um, Thrive at Work, which is the um, the health and
00:43:18.960 growth accelerator, um, is exactly that tension coming into play because what
00:43:24.000 we're trying to do through that is help retain people in the workforce because they've got skills, they've got passion,
00:43:30.560 they've got talent, and the only reason that they're potentially thinking about leaving is due to their health. So, how
00:43:36.160 do we support their health and well-being to to help them stay in work? Um however you've got policies and
00:43:42.960 financial pressures and all of those other things which are playing into that space to say um you know actually is it
00:43:49.599 time for me to move on do I need to get you know I need to think about myself actually the experience of you know
00:43:55.280 whether it anything we've talked about today some of the operational pressures um that job might not be right for that
00:44:01.680 person anymore and I think there is always that individuality there that we've got to got to try and take care of
00:44:07.760 um but I think the point I would make is that by working together and sharing insights and assets across the
00:44:14.880 organizations in leads um we've got a better chance of trying to support the individuals who who can access those
00:44:20.960 benefits. Um thanks for that. I um I feel like there might be a um a specific issue
00:44:28.880 that you're aware of councelor France Mia um but may may not be the right forum to discuss it in. So if if there's
00:44:36.400 a specific issue, I'd encourage you to write to me and Angela and then we'll engage with Darren about that item and
00:44:42.480 we might be able to find the resolution because it does feel like there I think it's this specific um question.
00:44:51.200 Okay, I'm going to bring in councelor Brmley next.
00:44:57.839 Thank you. Um really interesting conversation and and helpful so far. I just wanted to bring back to the point
00:45:03.680 that you was um mentioning on um racial situations that are occurring. Um do we
00:45:11.119 have any sense of responsibility in um cracking down on misinformation, disinformation that will be consumed by
00:45:17.520 people more likely to be isolated um out and about if I if I based everything on
00:45:23.280 the community of what I saw online um or was fed through particular channels, I'd feel like everything was really great
00:45:29.040 and everybody's opinion was the same. But once I get out and about and start talking to people, you have a realization that things aren't quite as
00:45:36.160 dire. But also a sense that people do um are able to to communicate and and form
00:45:43.599 a community together, but if you were isolated, you'd be more likely to believe um the things that are fed. Is
00:45:49.760 there a sense that that that might be a responsibility of ours that we could provide along with care? Um or is this
00:45:56.400 something that has been discussed before?
00:46:01.920 Um, so I I can certainly pick up a bit of that. I don't know if colleagues from uh council and NHS want to jump in as
00:46:07.200 well. Um, so I think we absolutely recognize that as employers, everybody
00:46:12.240 in the city's got a responsibility to try and make sure that they're challenging any misinformation,
00:46:17.359 miscommunication, and trying to create um an environment where people are able to have open conversations and to
00:46:24.160 question and challenge. Um so we put we put on collectively we do a lot of training around um how to have difficult
00:46:30.880 conversations, how to be an active bystander, how to um create an open
00:46:36.000 psychologically safe culture where you can have some of those difficult um debates and discussions and and question
00:46:42.240 and challenge um some of the things that you hear or see or or etc. Um, I think
00:46:47.680 it is such a a a kind of pervasive issue across communities that it's not
00:46:52.960 something that employers are going to be able to solve by themselves. So, I think there is absolutely working with our
00:46:58.720 VCSE colleagues in in the community sector, working with community groups. Darren's referenced um networks that
00:47:06.160 we've got across the system um who have got really good contacts and insights into what's happening. Um we also
00:47:12.319 actually work with our universities and research partners to understand what's happening elsewhere in the world. You
00:47:17.359 know leadeds is not a completely unique place which we often think it is but it's um it's what can we learn from
00:47:24.000 other cities where who have actively tackled some of this um stuff which is you know is it's global isn't it? You
00:47:30.880 see it in in every country in one way or another. So, so I think we um recognize
00:47:35.920 that we've got a responsibility to look out and try and um connect some of that learning back into how we play things in
00:47:42.079 leads. Um and it's not just one, it's not going to be resolved by just one sector or one employer. It's going to
00:47:48.319 have to be all of our responsibilities.
00:47:54.720 Um I was also thinking is not just deliberate disinformation. Um well it
00:47:59.760 does tie into that but also AI videos and and anything that could be exposed to. It almost seems that we should be
00:48:05.760 have an element of care to to people that this is an important aspect that they could be exposed to and how are we
00:48:13.440 implementing um a care around that along with physical care if that makes sense.
00:48:21.920 Um so I mean I'll ask colleagues to come in if relevant but certainly from from where I sit across the partnership I see
00:48:28.559 a lot of our accountable officers and chief executive officers um actively stepping into that communication space.
00:48:35.119 So if something has gone viral or there's been something in the media, they will proactively make a statement
00:48:40.880 about it, sending out communications to staff to clarify what the position is.
00:48:46.079 Um and that happens a lot because often um what happens in in um health and social care is subject to either social
00:48:52.720 media or media attention. Um so I think there is quite a lot of proactive communication across across to work to
00:48:59.760 members of the workforce around um clarifying things. Um and there's quite
00:49:04.880 a lot of open sessions as well with senior officers where staff can ask questions and and get into discussions
00:49:11.119 with them. Um, and I know that there's certainly ways in which people can contact senior officers to clarify
00:49:16.800 things. So, if they've seen or heard something that they're not sure about, they're um encouraged to to to do that.
00:49:23.760 Um, but yeah, there's always more more that we can do.
00:49:29.359 Yeah, thanks for that. And and I think there is there's a responsibility in all of us, isn't there, to call out um um
00:49:36.079 misinformation or lies as we used to call them. Okay, I'm going to bring in uh councelor Taylor.
00:49:43.200 Thanks, Chair. Um I'm not going to prolong with this because the report is absolutely brilliant, but let me go back
00:49:50.559 against the racism and what's in the workplace. I was the equality lead for numbers of years and I had staff from
00:49:57.200 the NHS, the council, schools, from the BAME community, other communities. I'm
00:50:03.760 not going to go all into in fact, but can I just ask one question? It's the people around the table that
00:50:10.400 makes a difference. When you're having these conversation, I can speak for you,
00:50:16.480 but when you have different culture that understand culture, you will have a
00:50:21.680 better conversation. And don't want to go further, but listen to what you're saying. You are trying, but you are only
00:50:28.559 halfway there if you don't have everyone around the table. And what I'm seeing and witnessing is going back to the 60s,
00:50:36.880 50s when my dad just came to England and many others. And we need conversation.
00:50:43.680 We more have more equality. So get everyone around the table who understand the individuals.
00:50:50.640 Thank you. Thank you. I I think that's probably a comment. Um thank you councelor Taylor.
00:50:58.319 Um okay. I can't see anyone else indicating. So just um just uh go back
00:51:05.839 to what our recommendations were um to consider the report um and talk about it
00:51:12.000 basically which which we've done. I just like to um thank you for coming today. I think there's a real um and thank
00:51:19.440 councelor Gibbs in particular for bringing up this year he did because I think it is really important and something we need to reflect on um
00:51:26.800 probably more than we have done because it's I think sometimes it's those implications of the wider context that
00:51:34.640 we don't see dayto-day and um particularly uh low paid carers who
00:51:39.920 doing a job that is really hard and very skilled as you said councelor Gibson um undervalued in my to um getting the
00:51:48.160 brunt of some of the stick. So I think that's something worth reflecting on. Um
00:51:53.920 okay, so I'm going to move us on now to item item eight. That's 27 of your
00:51:59.520 packs. Um I think Helen is going to introduce this paper. So over to you
00:52:06.000 Helen. Thank you councelor Scopes. Um thank you everyone. Um I'm here today to uh to
00:52:12.960 share the contents of the paper on our uh preparedness for winter resilience in the leads health and care partnership.
00:52:18.960 Um and obviously you've all had sight of the paper. But just to pull out a few key points is that um this is a winter
00:52:25.680 resilience plan with an overview of the system. Um but organizations do have more detailed individual plans. Um but
00:52:33.599 it does pull together in terms of where we're working collaboratively and as as collaboratively and as partners um to to
00:52:40.400 prepare ourselves for what we expect will be winter surges. Um it is written partly in the context of the urgent and
00:52:47.040 emergency care plan which was an additional document published in June 25 and that detailed seven key metrics for
00:52:54.160 us which we will be measured against in terms of performance. Some of those are um where we've already been benchmarking
00:53:00.960 against and some of those provide um uh added overview on on particular areas.
00:53:06.480 Um so we have taken that into context in terms of what we needed to mobilize additionally for winter. Heightened
00:53:13.119 winter pressures are to be expected. Um and we usually model ourselves on what's
00:53:18.400 happening in the southern hemisphere in the previous six months and the modeling tells us that we are largely to expect a
00:53:25.200 winter similar to last year. So we will see those increases in respiratory illnesses in flu. Um last year we
00:53:32.640 started to see those peaking towards the end of November uh and mid December. Um
00:53:38.000 towards early January was when we really saw those pressures. It it was quite long and sustained. So we didn't hit a
00:53:44.800 real sharp peak and then drop off. We we slowly increase. We did reach the peak. Um but then there was quite a long tail
00:53:51.280 off to the winter period. So we are expecting based on that southern hemisphere predictability
00:53:57.520 um that we will see something similar um and particularly around surges in respiratory illness where where
00:54:03.760 individuals are vulnerable uh to respiratory conditions taking into account um our seasonal changes with the
00:54:10.880 weather and that additional vulnerability. Um in response to that we do have a
00:54:15.920 divine defined oversight and governance structure. So we are um well placaced and prepared to respond as appropriate.
00:54:23.280 Um we come together as partners on a very frequent basis and have the ability to escalate with more senior partners
00:54:30.240 depending um what we are faced with at any given moment in time in the system.
00:54:35.359 Um so so those plans have been reviewed and are ready to operationalize and indeed some of them already are. Um
00:54:43.520 firstly we do look at um where we can gain traction in terms of prevention uh
00:54:48.559 and vaccination is a really key uh response to us for that particularly with the flu vaccination although we are
00:54:55.599 also running a COVID vaccination uh running alongside for those who meet
00:55:00.640 specific criteria. Um, COVID is no longer considered a a seasonal illness
00:55:06.640 um because we are seeing it all year although we will see slight variations given those who are particularly
00:55:12.400 vulnerable um to COVID infections um but we have started the uh vaccination for
00:55:18.319 flu and for children that started in September and for adults that's in October um and that can have huge
00:55:25.680 impacts in terms of that demand that we see um and vaccinating uh within
00:55:31.200 communities is and limiting that transmission and spread of the flu virus which for many um can result in those
00:55:38.880 attendances at hospital and emergency admissions that we would like to avoid.
00:55:44.000 Um alongside that our public health colleagues work up a uh winter prevention plan um and lots of
00:55:50.000 initiatives there to try and support people particularly vulnerable addressing uh loneliness, staying warm
00:55:55.680 at home etc. and supporting people to um live well in their communities over
00:56:00.960 these uh winter periods. Um as I mentioned earlier, provider colleagues do have um more defined plans, but
00:56:08.240 particularly responding to what we expect are additional pressures within our primary acute community and mental
00:56:13.760 health services um and where we might be able to maximize capacity as much as possible uh and provide flex when we
00:56:21.359 anticipate those surges will come in. And there's further details on those within the paper and colleagues have
00:56:26.799 joined me today if there's any specific questions around that. Um largely we
00:56:32.160 need to remain efficient around hospital discharges. So accepting that for some people hospital is the right setting for
00:56:38.480 them to go for treatment. But what we need to do is is treat them efficiently and facilitate a discharge in a timely
00:56:45.520 and appropriate manner for them to get back hopefully to their usual place of residence. be that home or be that back
00:56:51.520 to a care home that they might have come from. Um and lots of targeted work going
00:56:56.559 on to make sure that um partners work collaboratively together to um facilitate those discharges um as easily
00:57:05.040 as possible. Um and in response to that we have um through um funding with the
00:57:10.640 integrated care board we have uh funded and will be mobilizing um some additional services that we think will
00:57:17.200 have the greatest impact. So for example, we've already mobilized in September our um community pediatric um
00:57:25.280 respiratory hub. So that's a primary care provision um to to enable uh primary care to divert um children with
00:57:32.480 respiratory infections into a primary care provision. Hopefully enabling um some of those individuals to stay
00:57:38.559 outside of a hospital setting and certainly keep the capacity in the hospital setting for those who genuinely
00:57:44.160 need it. um that there is additional um staffing being mobilized particularly across health and within social care um
00:57:51.440 to provide um additional social work um availability which again um potentially
00:57:58.400 um keeps us on track for completing assessments in a timely manner um and enabling people to um have their
00:58:04.640 discharge um facilitated as quickly as possible. Um the paper goes on to
00:58:09.839 provide a summary of what we see are the key risks and the mitigations um that we've mobilized against those or will
00:58:16.079 mobilize. Um but but I think in summary it's um it highlights that we we are in
00:58:21.520 a strong but challenging position um notwithstanding all of the other external factors that are impacting
00:58:27.520 health and social care at the moment um but um but but entering in in strongest
00:58:33.599 position as we as possible. Thank you.
00:58:38.799 Thank you very much for that. Um appreciate that. Um so to members if you wanted to ask questions indicate in the
00:58:45.280 usual way. Um I'm going to start with a couple of questions that's okay. So um the first one's 49 page 49 and 50. to
00:58:53.200 the vaccine take up rates which um which a lot of the numbers are really low and
00:58:59.359 I understand it's flu rather than um maybe a normal immunization but I think
00:59:05.280 that that is concern and just appreciate your comments on what do you think is driving that um I think that'd be really
00:59:10.880 helpful and then the other question I had was on page 48 it looks like for a
00:59:16.160 lot of the periods um there's more people in than the total available beds
00:59:21.440 so just um can Can you explain how you're managing that? Thank you.
00:59:29.520 Uh yep. So the um the data on page 49 and 50 is the uptake rates from the
00:59:35.680 previous year for 2024 25. Um the feedback that we get from providers and
00:59:42.079 from patients around the reasons why uptake is low in a particular area and
00:59:48.400 varied. Um it can relate to availability and the access to appointments but we
00:59:54.559 also have challenges around language barriers, cultural barriers um and also
01:00:00.480 um dealing with things like misinformation, disinformation um and also um trusting uh um authority and and
01:00:10.400 kind of um statutory bodies. So there's there's a that the the reasons can be many and varied and we do try and work
01:00:17.440 with those um providers and also the voluntary community sector in those areas to try and address some of those
01:00:23.920 reasons um through raising awareness, providing um information and answering
01:00:28.960 any questions that the members of the community might have around um either access or the vaccinations themselves.
01:00:39.839 And and in answer to your next question um with regards to the table provided on um or the run chart on page 48 um
01:00:47.599 absolutely correct this is um a presentation of the data based on the modeling um that we expect and this is
01:00:53.920 the if we do nothing scenario um so this is the modeling provided by our acute trust colleagues that says given where
01:01:00.160 we expect demand to be this is where we would be if we didn't put anything additionally in and it's the modeling by
01:01:05.760 which we then start to build up our resilience around it. So additionally on top of this um we have LTH opening up a
01:01:12.319 number of additional um wards and beds across the wards but that doesn't um address all of it. So some of those
01:01:18.480 gains can be had in terms of the efficiency of those discharge processes. So like the additional staff that we
01:01:24.319 talked about etc. Utilizing the capacity within our virtual ward within our community setting etc. So that that
01:01:31.520 there are then a number of mitigations that build against that which then helpsly brings us back to a level
01:01:36.559 position. Thank you. Thanks Helen. That's really helpful. And I think Lindsay on your your point, it goes back
01:01:43.040 to what councelor Bombley was saying earlier about us all needing to help with disinformation. I think that's again uh important thing to note. Okay.
01:01:51.359 I'm going to um bring in councelor Blackburn. Thanks. Uh first of all, can I
01:01:57.920 congratulate on the report? It's been very very thorough. Um the thing is is
01:02:03.119 this um one thing I'd like to know is uh I sit on a body called the affordable
01:02:08.559 warmth partnership and at our last meeting we were discussing that because
01:02:13.839 of hot weather we've had the surge in summer. Um
01:02:19.680 are you finding you are getting that in through health service getting that surge in summer as well as the the
01:02:24.880 winter now? That's one thing. The other thing is um I I fall into a group. I'm
01:02:30.799 74 so I don't get a COVID job this year which I was very disappointed about. Uh and um I wonder have we got any early
01:02:38.000 indications of the people round about my you know 65 to to 75. Uh if if we're
01:02:45.200 getting an increase in COVID amongst that age group. And then finally, I was going to mention something about about
01:02:51.440 numbers, about take up and that, but the chair's covered that. But um also when
01:02:58.079 you get to a certain age, which I forget what it is now, is is you're entitled to a new one jab, which isn't a yearly jab,
01:03:03.920 but quite honestly, if you're in that older age group or you've got something wrong with you if you've got if you get
01:03:11.119 if you get flu or you get COVID in invariably you get pneumonia straight after and having that job protects you.
01:03:18.799 I mean, it protects you quite for quite a few years. Do we know what the number of of people of sort pensionable age
01:03:25.520 have t been uh have new money jabs?
01:03:33.119 Hi. Um I'll just come to your first point uh councelor Blackburn. I think you're absolutely right in terms of the
01:03:38.559 impacts of of heat on admissions and people seeking um health appointments.
01:03:44.480 Um the last time I came to scrutiny we were presenting the heat in the city uh DPH report which clearly um states that
01:03:53.200 you know we are starting to see a change in trends in terms of number of people who need medical assistance during our
01:04:00.240 hottest days and I think as a system there's a recognition that at some point
01:04:05.920 um you know we we will need to start having the same plans in place for for for summer and hot weather and
01:04:12.799 overheating as we do, you know, around around winter. You know, there's there's lots of work going on already. And we,
01:04:20.480 you know, when we look at excess deaths caused by temperature, you know, winter
01:04:26.240 is is still where we see our our highest number of deaths. However, we are seeing
01:04:31.760 a a slight shift in trends in terms of hot hot weather as well.
01:04:41.359 And just additionally to add to that and I don't know if any provider colleagues wish to add is that we we often don't
01:04:47.119 talk about um winter surges now. I think we just talk about seasonal surges um because winter planning is almost all
01:04:54.160 year round and and the paper does make reference to that governance structure. Um and it isn't a structure that's just
01:05:00.480 in place there for winter. it is actually utilized all year and there are occasions you know certainly throughout
01:05:06.160 those summer periods um where we where we have those surges in demand be it because of weather etc um where we do
01:05:12.559 actually invoke those structures uh and we do actually you know get together as a silver meeting etc and have to respond
01:05:19.039 um to those particular pressures at that time so so yes we are seeing it uh and we are having to mobilize to respond to
01:05:25.599 it so thank you Sam do you want to come in yes I think in response to the um surges
01:05:32.319 that happen throughout the year. I think it's just worth reflecting on how good the partnership is across the providers
01:05:38.240 across health and social care. So that if one partner is feeling the pressure of that surge, people come together to
01:05:45.280 try and and work work the problem through together. Thank you. Councelor Benny, did you want
01:05:50.400 to come in? Yeah, I was following on. really glad you asked that question, councelor Blackburn, because um as Hannah said,
01:05:58.160 when we were last here, we were presenting the um scoot the DPH report
01:06:04.079 and we talked about the fact that we've always had this focus on winter planning and we need to have the same mentality
01:06:11.599 around planning for heat and thinking about how we work through, you know, neighborhood networks around that and
01:06:17.680 how we get messages out into our communities. So chair, I think this was a suggestion for you actually. Um
01:06:24.319 because it's always been a tradition of this board that there's a session on winter planning. um I'd suggest you do a
01:06:30.880 session on summer planning which is very much taking forward you know a recommendation of the DPH report and
01:06:38.400 it's giving um it's giving um it's giving heat the parity it needs to have
01:06:44.160 with cold in recognizing it as a health issue and particularly for for as we
01:06:49.839 discussed last month for certain groups and also there's a really clear health inequality that it's people living in
01:06:57.280 you know the most um deprived in city areas in particular housing that are most at risk. So yeah, I wanted to
01:07:03.680 suggest you consider factoring that into your work plan that you do an actual focus session on planning for summer as
01:07:09.680 a health issue. Thank you. Thanks Councel Benny. Did you have a followup council
01:07:20.720 in report if you haven't got it? I mean if you can let us have it afterwards. uh and then as I say early indicators of of
01:07:29.039 taking away from you well younger people as such if we call somebody 74 younger
01:07:34.400 but but um the uh the the co job has it have you seen any effect?
01:07:43.359 Um yep. So I don't have any uh details on the impact of not vaccinating younger
01:07:49.440 cohorts around COVID infections. Um at the moment um we've only just started
01:07:54.640 the COVID vaccination campaign. So we'll we'll work with our public health colleagues in um health security agency
01:08:00.720 to see if there is any impact. Um just on the point around the new makal vaccination. So the the uptake of the
01:08:07.119 new makal vaccination is around about 70% um each year. Um and we encourage our
01:08:14.319 providers to take a make any contact count approach where they can co-administer other vaccinations
01:08:21.120 alongside the flu and COVID vaccination if um if the patient is happy to have
01:08:26.319 those at the same appointment. So um this year um providers are also offering
01:08:32.000 um the RSV vaccination the respiratory sensitial virus um pneumonia um shingles
01:08:39.040 and flu and COVID um is available to patients if if they're eligible in those groups as well to try and and protect
01:08:45.439 those those patients. You you'd be happy to know I've taken
01:08:50.960 all of them over last year since when I'm entitled to uh and I've also got my name down for the first on the list if
01:08:57.600 they come up with a an an antiarthritis um jab.
01:09:03.359 Thank you. Thanks councelor Blackburn and um councelor Ver. Thank you for your suggestion. I'll take that away and
01:09:09.279 think about it and if we can squeeze it into the agenda but I do think you're right that um it's a slightly different
01:09:16.080 demographic but the heat is definitely affecting people and we saw the graphs last time particularly um H you used
01:09:23.439 excess deaths or a death spike at those points so thank you for that. Okay, I'm going to bring in councelor Anderson
01:09:29.279 next. Thank you chair. I just wanted to ask about the messaging for the vaccines this year because there seems to be
01:09:35.439 quite a lot of confusion amongst people as to who's entitled and who isn't and people have been turning up at the
01:09:41.359 doctors expecting a co jab and not being able to get one. So, what do you think has gone wrong there? And why are under
01:09:48.719 75s uh no longer allowed a COVID jab and frontline health workers as well?
01:09:54.400 Because it does seem if it's totally down to money, then it's a completely false economy because if health
01:09:59.679 frontline health workers go off sick and you have to replace them with agency staff, that costs a lot more. Um, so
01:10:06.320 what's the reasoning behind that, please? And also, I read about somebody having a private COVID job and paying
01:10:13.040 £100 for it. I thought there was no such thing as private COVID jobs. I mean, I've paid for a flu jab myself, but I
01:10:20.719 didn't think you could pay for a COVID job. Thank you.
01:10:28.400 Um, yes. So, I'll try and answer those questions. So, um, the the COVID jab was
01:10:33.840 made available privately last year. So, so you can um purchase it. Um, the the regulations on on who can offer it um
01:10:41.199 changed. Um just remembering what the other questions were now.
01:10:49.199 The messaging. The messaging. Yes. Um so um so yes, we have had some feedback from patients and
01:10:55.120 providers to say that um that that has been flagged as a a potential issue that people are not aware that the criteria
01:11:02.080 for co vaccinations have changed this year. Um I think every year we we have
01:11:08.159 the national uh comm's campaign begin kind of later than the start of the
01:11:13.440 campaign. People start planning quite early to get their winter vaccinations in some areas. Um and I think yes the
01:11:20.080 messaging um should have been better around the changes to the campaign. So we are working on on getting some uh
01:11:26.880 messages out to the public around the the changes. The reduction in um the
01:11:32.880 eligible cohorts for COVID this year was based on the recommendations of the joint vaccination and immunization
01:11:38.320 committee. Um and I think what they'd found from the evidence is that um those groups that were previously vaccinated,
01:11:44.960 so the clinical risk groups and the in the younger age cohorts were not actually at at um as high risk of severe
01:11:53.440 illness and hospitalization as some of our older uh more vulnerable patients and those in um care homes. And so the
01:12:00.800 criteria was adjusted to um to specifically target those at the most
01:12:05.840 risk of hospitalization and severe illness and possible death.
01:12:11.120 Yeah, thanks for that. But it's really interesting point, councelor Anderson, because there's something around sickness as well as hospitalization
01:12:17.600 around particularly around staff who are um who be off sick even if they're not
01:12:23.360 hospitalized. So I think that's a really interesting point. Hannah, do you want to comment on that and then you can come back in? Lindsay,
01:12:28.960 it was just to comment around um messaging actually and I think our role
01:12:34.000 um within the health protection team within the public health directorate is to make sure that all of that NHS
01:12:40.640 messaging and eligibility is is cascaded through our um third sector colleagues
01:12:46.080 and community contacts. you know, making sure that it's, you know, um the messaging is in accessible community
01:12:52.640 languages that, you know, there's there's a really important um focus on
01:12:57.920 using our community champions, which is uh funded through NHS money, um to to
01:13:03.679 have that sort of trusted voice within communities to be able to answer some of the questions that might be um either
01:13:09.760 stopping people from having vaccines or, you know, any confusion around changes in eligibility. I know certainly from a
01:13:16.960 public health perspective, we've also funded uh leads older people's forum to do lots of targeted work with people
01:13:23.199 this year around those changes in eligibility and and to to listen to people who may be struggling to access
01:13:29.440 vaccines and and look at how they can support them to to access those vaccines. Um, so yeah, just to just to
01:13:36.320 emphasize that from a public health perspective, we very much support kind of from a prevention and making sure
01:13:41.600 that information is there and if it hasn't already happened, there will be there's regular updates that go into the
01:13:47.840 members fortnightly um briefing as well, you know, with with just some of the work that we're doing that you can
01:13:53.360 cascade as well.
01:13:59.040 Yeah. So, I was just going to come back in on the staff vaccination element. So we recognize that that is a a
01:14:04.080 significant risk to the system and and has been um listed as one of our key priorities for this year. Um so our
01:14:11.440 objective is to try and increase uptake by at least 5% amongst um the various staff groups across the city. um working
01:14:18.480 with different providers to make sure that um staff have access to vaccination and also are aware of the other um
01:14:25.360 places that they can get vaccinated whether that's their own GP or community pharmacy as well as the occupational
01:14:31.280 health um services that their their own employers provide. Um we've also been
01:14:36.400 contacting uh social care providers so care homes, domicillary care providers, hospices to make sure that their staff
01:14:42.880 are also aware of how they can access um the vaccinations. um and making sure
01:14:48.159 that um our voluntary and community sector partners are also made aware of how their staff can also access um the
01:14:54.800 winter vaccinations as well to make sure they're protected and try and reduce the impact on the system of of staff absence
01:15:00.719 due to respiratory illness. Thank you very much Lindsay. Okay, going
01:15:05.760 to bring in Jonathan next. Thank you. I'd just like to focus on um
01:15:12.960 uh number 10 around mental health services. uh with a few questions. Um firstly, is
01:15:21.040 is there actually a winter surge around people with uh mental health issues or
01:15:28.480 is it like we were talking about before pressure the whole year round? It sounds from what you were saying like there's a
01:15:34.000 very high amount of pressure and if there is is that focused around
01:15:40.000 particular communities and do you know which those are and are you able to
01:15:45.840 tailor the services available to them. Thirdly, we know there have been quite a
01:15:52.000 lot of issues around the new 111 service and uh be interesting to know how you're
01:15:58.880 mitigating those uh as we move uh uh into the winter. Um and the fact that it
01:16:07.040 looks like the service is under so much pressure anyway, it just leaves me a bit worried about what is going to happen if
01:16:14.400 there is a surge.
01:16:21.120 Thank you. Um so in terms is there room to search for mental health services we
01:16:27.360 don't see it in the same way as our colleagues in the acute trust and in community do we do see uh generally
01:16:35.920 uh peaking activity usually January time mid mid Januaryish
01:16:42.480 around that time um but generally it's no more additional pressure in the
01:16:49.280 system than we experience all year round and as Helen outlined we have an all
01:16:56.000 yearround system in place to help manage that demand.
01:17:02.239 Um in terms of when we do see surges are there particular communities um I don't
01:17:10.080 think I can answer that for you today but what I will do is take that away and provide some information to the chair
01:17:18.080 following this meeting. Um in in response to that um
01:17:26.080 I am aware that we have commissioned some additional services through smaller
01:17:32.800 community groups um voluntary based groups to support particular
01:17:40.320 um population groups throughout the city. Um so we've had some very good
01:17:47.280 examples of where that's worked and um there's been a very helpful report
01:17:54.239 published by uh forum central about the effectiveness of these grassroots
01:18:00.159 organizations and the support that they've given particularly to our community services.
01:18:07.920 Um, in relation to your 111 question, um, I think that's more difficult for us
01:18:13.920 for me to answer today because we
01:18:19.520 the um the commissioning of the 111 system, as
01:18:25.280 you're aware, is a West Yorkshire commissioned organization. And so it's
01:18:30.320 the West Yorkshire ICB that will be having those discussions about the winter resilience planning with the 111
01:18:37.520 provider and um we we as a system meet
01:18:43.040 and have discussions about is that support there and is it going to be resilient for us and as far as we're
01:18:49.920 aware that is the case but I don't as I say we don't have the detail on that.
01:18:55.440 Maybe Helen can answer that. Thank you, Allison. Um, I don't have the
01:19:01.120 specific detail on it. Um, and I don't have a representative here today from the Yorkshire Ambulance Service who who
01:19:06.159 is our provider of our 111 service across Yorkshire. Um, but having previously worked for that organization.
01:19:12.239 Um, what I can say is that, you know, they are very robust in terms of resilience. What they do have the
01:19:17.520 ability to do is to um, bounce those um, that demand into other services. So 111
01:19:23.040 is obviously a national um service and between call centers from one region to the next um there is a lot of resilience
01:19:30.159 built around being able to draw on that capacity um when one area is peing over another. Um the other thing that we
01:19:37.199 undertake is that um the 111 service is almost as good as our directory of service. A directory of service um is
01:19:44.400 basically what 111 can can access um based on somebody describing their
01:19:49.440 symptoms um and can direct them to a number of alternatives besides dispatching an ambulance or recommending
01:19:55.600 that somebody attends an A&E department which ideally is is where we want that
01:20:01.040 to happen. um if an ambulance or or an ED attendance isn't appropriate for that individual and all services are
01:20:08.159 encouraged um in that winter preparedness to actually update their directory of services. So be that um
01:20:14.560 alternative procision provisions for urgent care. It could be for accessing you know urgent opthalmic services in
01:20:21.440 the community. It could be about your primary care services. It could be where you know to go with a child with a you
01:20:27.040 know respiratory complaint etc. Um, and we need to make sure that that's up to date, that we have service operating and
01:20:33.040 opening times, how to access that service, etc., so that when those calls go into 111, that they're really well
01:20:38.960 placed to be able to, um, divert those individuals into the most appropriate services. So, um, without a colleague
01:20:46.320 working directly in there, I think that's the best summary, but I'm more than happy to provide more detailed information if you require it.
01:20:53.120 Thank you. I'll bring councelor Venner in. Yeah, I just wanted to respond to your
01:20:58.560 question, Jonathan, about the summer um about the seasonal mental health surge.
01:21:04.880 So, when I was at lead survivor crisis service, which is I left this six years ago, so my information might be out of
01:21:11.120 date, but I doubt much has changed really at that time like our service peaks would mirror the NHS LFT crisis
01:21:18.960 team. Unsurprisingly, Christmas and New Year was always one of our busiest times. We'd also get the slump in
01:21:26.239 January that Allison described which sometimes felt like people had held themselves together through a really
01:21:31.360 challenging time of year and then and then collapsed. We also had a seasonal peak that always really surprised
01:21:37.280 people. I'd be interested to hear if it's still the same in your crisis team that we had a high summer seasonal peak.
01:21:43.840 And um we came to the view that it was because there's aspects of summer that
01:21:48.960 are quite like Christmas in that services are a bit thin on the ground because staff are on leave. So people
01:21:55.360 might have, you know, people who normally support them who aren't around because they're on holiday. But also the
01:22:02.159 height of summer, I think like Christmas can be a time when loneliness and isolation are really magnified. Like
01:22:08.960 summer's a time when lots of people look like they're having a good time and are going on holiday and there can be a real
01:22:14.239 sense of discord if you're very depressed and the sun's shining. So um if you do do a scrutiny
01:22:21.840 um meeting about summer preparedness, I think it'd be really interesting to um
01:22:27.760 look at whether there is that height of summer seasonal peak because we certainly experienced that and I don't
01:22:33.040 know if you still do Allison, but yeah, us and the crisis team used to tend to be really busy in August and we thought
01:22:39.600 it was yeah, in some ways being quite comparable to Christmas. So that'll be
01:22:44.639 another thing to look at for yeah summer preparedness. Thank you. Thank you. Cena, do you have a a
01:22:50.719 supplementary Jonathan? Uh thank you. Well, I gave you a good segue into the summer thing there and I
01:22:56.960 think it would be really interesting to look at that. Uh I think it would be helpful if we could get more information
01:23:03.280 around 111 and the way in which um the
01:23:08.400 the robustness of that is actually working for leads because although it might be a West Yorkshire contract
01:23:14.159 that's what our focus is here and there are some vulnerabilities around that.
01:23:19.280 Yes, thanks Jonathan. I agree with you and and I think it's quite it's quite pertinent to understand the process of
01:23:24.639 the director of service if there's another region taking our calls in a surge time. Do
01:23:31.199 they have all the information specifically again about leads because we'll be parochial about that on the
01:23:36.560 same shamely as the leads uh scrutiny board. So that's fine. Um Allison, do
01:23:42.960 you want to come back in? Yeah. Yes. Just a point of clarification. Um, chair, the comments I was making in
01:23:49.280 relation to 111 were in relation to the mental health option, which I've had many a conversation with Healthw Watch
01:23:54.880 about, not the wider 111 service that is provided by the Yorkshire Ambulance
01:24:00.159 Service. Yeah. And and I think Jonathan's particularly interesting in the mental
01:24:06.080 health point, but I think it's a it's an interesting question anyway. Okay, good.
01:24:11.120 Um, I'm going to bring in Councelor Brmley next. Thank you, Chair. um only last week um a
01:24:18.159 resident got in touch with me because they'd been on the phone for about an hour waiting to get through to the doctor. Um and so then they gave up and
01:24:26.400 tried to to go through the website link but struggled with the app and etc. So they decided to email me and that seemed
01:24:32.960 to be the easier of the three different options. Um so um and and and I replied
01:24:38.320 in quite a hurry, really worried I was then on an emergency uh reply um to to to to go through to 111, which seemed
01:24:45.040 most straightforward advice um in that scenario. um as it didn't seem to be an
01:24:50.159 emergency. Um but in terms of it, it struck me as um wild that they didn't
01:24:57.679 already know that they could call through to 111. Um and that that wasn't just information that was given while
01:25:03.679 they're on hold to the doctors, especially for an hour, but I think it's quite a length of time. And I just wondered, do we ever put across a
01:25:09.360 template to doctors what would be really helpful overall to have on the answer phone while people are on call um on
01:25:16.000 hold? Um, and also within that, could that not then be tied up with what uh
01:25:22.239 information is is up to date regarding vaccinations? Um, and what to do if you
01:25:27.440 um, you know, can't get through to somebody to get an appointment, especially if we're talking about the winter surge um, and elderly members
01:25:33.679 that are probably going to want it to be more of a phone call rather than going on to um, an NHS app and an awareness
01:25:39.840 that you can also pop into the pharmacy as well. Thank you. Thank you. I I noticed that you said
01:25:46.000 earlier you didn't have a someone from 111 here. So feel free to ask what you can, but also feel free to say you're
01:25:51.440 right that gu. Yeah, again I don't have a direct um
01:25:57.280 primary care colleague here. Um unless is Lindsay in a position to Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
01:26:04.320 Uh yeah, so I'm happy to answer that that question. Part of my role within the primary care team is around um
01:26:10.000 digital technology. So we we've recently completed a project in leads around uh
01:26:16.080 improving practices telefan systems so that they're able to provide more information whilst patients are um
01:26:23.120 queuing uh to change them over to digital telefan systems that allow uh
01:26:29.199 allow patients to queue rather than to hear an engaged tone um and choose different options depending on on what
01:26:35.760 their needs are. Um and also uh quite a lot of our practices have also introduced a functionality called keep
01:26:42.000 my place in queue where patient can um press the button um hang up the phone
01:26:47.760 and then uh the practice will call them back when they reach the front of the queue. So that's that's improved um
01:26:54.080 access across a number of practices. We do encourage practice to think about the messages that they use whilst patients
01:27:00.880 are queuing. they do have control over those messages and can edit them and and record them as they see fit. And and a
01:27:07.840 number of practice have have used, you know, senior GP partners to um share
01:27:13.120 messages around uh how to access services, the different routes into into accessing services and and whatever the
01:27:19.840 key kind of campaign messages are um at at the time. um and practices will share
01:27:26.239 information on their websites and social media platforms if they have them around uh the different routes to access care.
01:27:33.520 So um whether that's a online consultation uh platform or or by uh
01:27:39.120 using the NHS app um to either submit requests or to book appointments if they're available.
01:27:46.960 Thank you very much. you guys a followup
01:27:52.639 if we have that fed back to us from residents at times where they say we didn't weren't privy to the information
01:27:58.560 that would have been helpful to us in that scenario while waiting for an appointment who who would you advise is
01:28:04.880 then our point of contact is it the individual doctor uh doctor surgery um
01:28:10.000 or is it the sort of NHS provider line um I I just thinking about that as well
01:28:15.760 councelor Brumley and um I was thinking maybe we should make a recommendation that we write to the confederation of G
01:28:21.920 lead GPS um as a scrutiny board um if if other members are satisfied with
01:28:29.120 that saying encouraging them to put a voicemail message around 111 around um
01:28:35.040 the vaccinations as well. I think that might be helpful and sorry I don't know if you want to comment on that as well
01:28:40.480 Lindsay I'll give you the opportunity but those were my thoughts. Um yeah, I suppose the the two different
01:28:46.480 options would be to either raise it directly with the practice manager um to provide feedback on on any issues that a
01:28:52.719 patient might be struggling with um or um equally you can contact the primary care team at West Yorkshire ICB. Um we
01:29:00.400 have a dedicated team that supports practices in leads um which I'm part of and we can then support that practice
01:29:06.080 with any particular access issues that patients might be um experiencing and also help them with any communication
01:29:12.639 messages and and uh ways of getting information out there to patients around what the current model of of delivering
01:29:19.199 their primary care services happens to be for their practice. Thank you Lindsay. So, so, so I think
01:29:24.800 there's a there's a casework piece of you which is your uh GP practice, but I
01:29:30.960 think for us there is a um something around writing to the confederation also sign posting them back to the ICB if
01:29:36.719 they need support on how how to do that. So, thanks for that Lindsay. Okay, I'm going to bring in uh councelor Richie.
01:29:43.199 Councelor Richie is my last on the list. If anyone else wants to talk, do indicate while he's speaking. Thank you.
01:29:51.280 Thank you, Chair. While writing to the Confederation of GPS, I wonder if it'd
01:29:57.679 be appropriate and helpful to ask if they've circulated the easy read
01:30:03.520 compliments and complaints form that a lot of work went into putting together.
01:30:09.840 um because the number of GP practices I've spoken to the suggestion is is not
01:30:19.760 which is a bit disappointing because a lot of effort went into putting that together with people from lived
01:30:25.120 experience. But actually my main question was around
01:30:30.480 the fluent vaccination uptake and the ethnicity ethnicity split
01:30:37.520 which I know there's been lots of initiatives um to get a more diverse uptake of the
01:30:45.199 vaccination but the figures are quite stark as to the outside white British and white
01:30:52.320 Irish. some um groups are particularly
01:30:58.080 well not taking the vaccine. So I just wondered if we'd actually done
01:31:03.440 a piece of work to find out why. Is it more hesit hesitancy in those
01:31:09.040 communities? Is it access? Is it uh the language? uh the um initiatives that
01:31:15.360 we've had in the past um not having any effect at all.
01:31:25.600 Um I suppose the answer to that question is all of the above. Um the the the reasons why people choose not to take up
01:31:32.800 um vaccination offer is is different depending on the specific community that
01:31:37.840 we might be addressing. Um so we try and encourage providers to actually look at
01:31:43.360 the particular reasons for a community. Um we know that some communities have
01:31:48.560 cultural um reasons to do with the nasal flu vaccination and the porcene gelatin
01:31:53.920 content of that. So this year we've been encouraging people to make sure that patients are aware of alternatives that that are available to them um if if they
01:32:01.840 don't want to have um the the nasal flu um vaccine. Um but it it depends on uh
01:32:08.719 it depends on the particular group of of people that we're working with and and we're trying to learn from from that
01:32:15.440 community and and address the particular issues whether that is uh access around
01:32:21.120 days or times um that are more difficult for them or putting in other measures um
01:32:27.520 around uh trusted uh messages from community leaders etc. to try and encourage them
01:32:33.920 to take um the offer that we're giving to them. But it's a it's an ongoing kind
01:32:39.520 of challenge to to deal with um because the reasons are varied and and change
01:32:45.040 depending on the particular um community group that you're actually working with.
01:32:51.199 Um would you be able to give us a sort of a a quick not necessarily now but in an email a quick summary of what the
01:32:58.080 challenges are for each community and what we're doing to tackle them because um you I mean I don't want to be overly
01:33:06.320 critical but you'll know that this is sort of sticky problem isn't it where um
01:33:12.000 which which is concerning and and I guess there's something about building
01:33:18.239 trusting communities I think that's really good and getting good role models. I think that's also really important. So, yeah, that'd be quite
01:33:23.600 helpful after the meeting. Um, Council Rich, do you have a supplementary or follow up on that? No. No. Okay. Um,
01:33:32.639 okay. So, um, that's got to end of the questions. So I just just reiterate that we um as a
01:33:41.199 recommendation we'll write to the Confederation of GPS around trying to get better answer phone messages and
01:33:46.880 messages in while you're waiting for the um G GP. Uh if you're waiting for phone
01:33:54.080 for appointments, I think that that is a good thing that we could write about. Um other than that, I think our
01:33:59.440 recommendation is to note the report. So um with that, thank you very much for coming. I really appreciate your time. I
01:34:05.600 think it's been really helpful and thanks for coming Lindsay to talk to us about vaccines. Um that has also been
01:34:11.360 helpful. So thanks for that and we're going to move on to the work program. I think uh guests you don't you don't have
01:34:17.440 to stay for this bit but it's a public meeting so you're very welcome to um stay. So okay. So we're going to move on
01:34:24.080 to item uh nine which is on page 53 which is the work schedule. Um
01:34:32.400 just looking ahead um obviously we've got
01:34:37.679 um we are in October we've got items in November December and we've got we've
01:34:43.360 talked a bit about the mental health stuff uh provision in leads in March 2026 as well earlier in the premeating.
01:34:51.360 Is there anything else any comments about the work program or anything else people want to raise about the work
01:34:56.639 program at this point? Oh yeah. Can uh Angela, do you want to
01:35:02.880 just come in? Yeah, just an update now is um in
01:35:08.159 relation to our budget working group meeting um we have now got a date and time of that which is going to be
01:35:14.320 Tuesday 16th of December at 11:00. So um I will be circulating the invitation
01:35:20.000 after this meeting. Thank you. Thank you. And um as mentioned in the
01:35:26.320 preme again you you'll have noted that the the adults uh department is behind on on their budget and they presented to
01:35:33.280 strategy resources. You can go back and watch that if you're interested in the details but we'll obviously need to be
01:35:38.960 asking questions ourselves in December as well. Okay. Any other comments on
01:35:45.040 this uh work plan? No. Great. Okay. So then date and time of next meeting is
01:35:52.400 Tuesday the 18th of November 1:30 back here. Obviously we have a premeating at 1. Thanks everyone for your attendance
01:35:58.560 and uh participation today. I think we've had an interesting meeting. Um and
01:36:03.600 I'll see you next time. Thank you.
