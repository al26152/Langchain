## Executive Summary

This strategic analysis examines workforce model transformation for integrated neighbourhood healthcare systems. The report synthesises evidence from NHS policy, strategic plans, and implementation guidance to support strategic thinking about how workforce and human resources structures will need to change in light of the NHS 10-Year Plan and the intention to deliver more integrated healthcare systems.

Our analysis focuses on four key areas: workforce model transformation, neighbourhood definition and structure, enabling the workforce to work across organisational boundaries, and critical implementation considerations for integrated care pilots.

### Key Findings

**Workforce Model Transformation: Key Changes and Competencies**

To support integrated healthcare delivery that spans primary care, secondary and third sector organisations, significant changes in workforce management are required [1, 3, 4]. These changes include increasing the primary care workforce, introducing new roles or altering existing ones, and promoting collaboration across sectors. New organisational models should focus on creating integrated trusts to provide comprehensive care, including social and public health services [2].

This transformation is not simply about numbers – it is about enabling the workforce to work differently. As evidence notes, "There is a consensus that the current configuration of primary care in some areas leaves the NHS ill-equipped to address the challenges facing the NHS and that new models of primary care are needed." The development of alternative professional roles in primary care, such as physician assistants, could be beneficial in filling capability gaps [3].

**Strategic implication:** Workforce strategy must position organisations to be flexible, adaptive, and ready to embrace new ways of working. Attracting, developing, and retaining talented people remains central to enabling this transformation.

**Neighbourhood Definition & Structure: Best Practices**

Evidence shows that in piloting an integrated neighbourhood model, neighbourhoods should be defined by population size, geographical boundaries, and service needs, with particular focus on priority areas with complex health needs [1, 2]. Integrated care models emphasise local collaboration and the alignment of services to improve health outcomes and reduce health inequalities [4, 5].

This evidence-based approach recognises that "Integrated Neighbourhoods (INs) were conceptualised in various ways to meet specific community health needs through localised, cross-sector collaboration" [1]. Research shows effective neighbourhoods typically serve populations between 30,000 and 50,000 people, though this varies based on geography, service configuration, and community structure [2].

Defining neighbourhoods with a focus on local needs and service alignment can facilitate targeted interventions, improving health outcomes and reducing service fragmentation. This localised, need-based approach will be effective precisely because it recognises the diversity of communities served and tailors responses accordingly.

**Strategic implication:** Human resources and workforce development strategies must align with neighbourhood-level thinking. This means enabling teams to develop closer relationships with their local communities and system partners.

---

**Boundary-Spanning Workforce: Enabling Staff to Work Across Organisations**

To enable a boundary-spanning workforce, it is crucial to overcome cultural barriers and promote collaboration across professional boundaries [1, 2]. As the evidence emphasises, "Delivering integrated care also requires staff to work differently and overcome pervasive cultural barriers" [2].

Models of collaboration among professionals and sectors, such as integrated trusts, can facilitate multi-organisation team working [1, 3]. One policy recommendation states: "We recommend that Primary Care Networks should move away from loose federations and instead practices should come together in new integrated trusts" [4].

The barriers are real and significant. They include entrenched organisational boundaries, professional silos, and ingrained ways of working. Yet the solution requires creating an environment that encourages cross-boundary collaboration. This is not primarily a structural challenge – it is a cultural one. Organisations must foster the mindsets, relationships, and shared purpose that enable staff to see themselves as part of a wider system.

**Strategic implication:** Investment in team development, cross-organisational working agreements, and leadership approaches that prioritise collaboration over competition is essential. System-wide identity and collaboration become vital enablers.

---

**Implementation Considerations: Critical Success Factors and Challenges**

Successful implementation of integrated care models requires addressing workforce imbalances, promoting inter-professional collaboration, and ensuring effective change management [1, 2]. Critical success factors include stakeholder engagement, clear governance structures, and continuous evaluation [3, 4].

The evidence shows that "The first phase focused on reviewing key documentation, including organisational strategies and interviews with a range of stakeholders" [2]. Additionally, "A new NHS workforce policy to support integrated care" is essential [2].

Implementation challenges are not insignificant. These include managing change at pace, ensuring all voices are heard in system partnerships, and addressing the risks of unequal power dynamics between different sized organisations. However, these challenges can be approached with both realism and optimism. Many of these risks can be mitigated through thoughtful change management, transparent communication, and genuine partnership working.

**Strategic implication:** Organisations must be intentional in designing and implementing these changes. Stakeholder engagement – including the workforce – is non-negotiable. Staff involvement in shaping how organisations work across boundaries is essential, and progress must be measured against human-centred outcomes, not just structural milestones.

## Detailed Strategic Findings

### 1. Workforce Model Transformation

The NHS must shift from a workforce organised primarily by organisation type toward a system organised around neighbourhood and population needs. This requires:

**Increasing Primary Care Capacity and Capability**

The evidence makes clear that current primary care configurations are inadequate to meet modern healthcare needs [3]. Organisations must expand primary care workforce capacity whilst simultaneously developing new roles that bridge traditional professional boundaries. Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other emerging roles offer ways to extend clinical capacity [3].

**Creating Integrated Organisational Structures**

New organisational models should focus on creating integrated trusts that provide comprehensive care spanning health, social care, and public health services [2]. This is not about removing professional identity – it is about creating structures that enable integration rather than fragment it.

**Promoting Cross-Sector Collaboration**

Collaboration across primary, secondary, and third sector organisations is essential. This requires deliberate investment in relationship-building, aligned incentives, and shared accountability for population health outcomes [1, 3].

### 2. Neighbourhood Definition and Structure

Evidence from integrated neighbourhood models identifies several key design principles:

**Population Size and Geography**

Neighbourhoods typically serve populations between 30,000 and 50,000 people, though this varies based on geography, service configuration, and community structure. Evidence-based approaches reflect careful analysis of population distribution and service complexity [2].

**Service Alignment**

The neighbourhood approach requires aligning primary care, community health services, social care, mental health, and third sector services around common populations and shared outcomes. This is more than co-location – it requires integrated care planning and shared clinical records [1].

**Focus on Equity and Health Inequalities**

Neighbourhood models should explicitly target areas with higher health needs and greater health inequalities. Evidence supports focusing on supporting people with long-term conditions in priority areas as part of an equity-focused approach [2].

### 3. Boundary-Spanning Workforce

The cultural shift required to enable boundary-spanning working is profound. Evidence suggests several key enablers:

**Clear Roles and Responsibilities**

Multi-organisation teams require absolute clarity about roles, decision-making authority, and accountability. Ambiguity about who is responsible for what creates conflict and inefficiency [1].

**Structured Referral Pathways**

Formal pathways for referral and communication between organisations reduce reliance on personal relationships and create sustainable systems [1].

**Technology Enablement**

Shared clinical systems, integrated scheduling, and unified communication platforms are essential infrastructure for boundary-spanning teams [1].

**Leadership and Cultural Change**

Perhaps most importantly, leaders must model collaborative behaviours, challenge organisational defensiveness, and reinforce system-level accountability [2]. Delivering integrated care requires staff to work differently, and this cultural change must be visible in leadership behaviours.

### 4. Implementation Considerations and Critical Success Factors

**Stakeholder Engagement and Partnership**

Success requires genuine engagement with all stakeholders – the workforce, system partners, patients and communities, and elected representatives. This is not consultation that happens at the end of a change process – it is co-design from the beginning [2].

**Clear Governance and Accountability**

Integrated systems require new governance arrangements that balance autonomy with accountability. These must be simple enough to be understood by everyone, yet robust enough to ensure effective decision-making [3].

**Continuous Evaluation and Learning**

Organisations must measure not only the structural changes (how many integrated trusts, how many shared staff posts) but also the human and clinical outcomes that matter: Are staff engaged? Is care improving? Are health inequalities reducing? [4].

**Resourcing and Investment**

Cultural change and integration require investment in training, leadership development, technology, and backfill for people engaged in transformation. Under-resourcing transformation is a false economy – it prolongs change and increases resistance [1, 2].

## Implications for Integrated Care Systems

As organisations think about their role in integrated neighbourhood healthcare models, several implications emerge for workforce and human resources strategy:

### Enable Staff to Think and Act at System Level

Staff need to see themselves as part of the wider health and social care system, not just as part of their parent organisation. This requires new organisational development approaches, performance management aligned to system outcomes, and leadership development that emphasises system thinking.

### Neighbourhood Approaches Must Be Real, Not Just Structural

Having neighbourhood teams is not the same as neighbourhood-based care. Organisations must support staff to develop deep relationships with their local communities, understand local needs, and have autonomy to respond to those needs.

### Actively Address Cultural Barriers

The evidence is clear that integration requires cultural change, not just structural change. Investment in team development across organisations, creation of spaces for honest conversations about professional identity and boundaries, and celebration of examples of successful boundary-spanning are all essential.

### Put the Workforce at the Centre of Change

The workforce is both the means and the end of integrated care. Staff will implement it, but they will only do so effectively if they feel valued, involved in decision-making, and supported to work in new ways.

## Recommendations

1. **Commission detailed workforce modelling** – Understand current workforce distribution across proposed neighbourhood areas and project future requirements under integrated models.

2. **Conduct staff engagement and co-design sessions** – Involve the workforce in thinking through how organisations will work across boundaries, what support is needed, and what needs to change in culture and systems.

3. **Develop a cultural change strategy** – Moving to neighbourhood and system-based thinking requires deliberate culture change work, not just structural reorganisation.

4. **Establish early partnerships and relationship-building** – Begin conversations with system partners about shared workforce development, aligned performance management, and integrated career pathways.

5. **Plan for continuous evaluation** – Build in measurement of human experience, clinical outcomes, and equity impact from the start, so organisations can learn and adapt as they implement.
