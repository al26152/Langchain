## 2. Missing or Underemphasized Themes

Analyzing whether previous themes (Leadership, System Partner) should be reconsidered or if new themes are emerging.

Based on the provided context and available sources, let's address each of the points:

1. **Leadership Theme**: 

   - **Should this be a standalone theme or is it adequately embedded in current themes?**
     - **Evidence on Leadership Development Needs**: The previous strategy (2021-25) included a specific focus on leadership, highlighting areas such as inclusive leadership, capability development, and succession planning. The NHS People Plan also emphasizes the importance of compassionate and inclusive leadership as a key driver for workforce effectiveness and retention (NHS England _ Planning framework for the NHS in England.md).
     - **Gaps if Currently Embedded**: While the current strategy includes "Organisation Design" and "Inclusion," which may touch on leadership aspects, these themes might not sufficiently cover the comprehensive development and support needed for effective leadership. Leadership development requires targeted initiatives and measurable outcomes, which may not be fully addressed under broader themes.

2. **System Partnership**:

   - **Is System Integration/Partnership Sufficiently Prominent?**
     - **Evidence on Collaborative Working Needs**: The NHS Long Term Workforce Plan and the NHS England Neighbourhood Health Guidelines emphasize the importance of partnership working capabilities across all staff groups. System integration is critical for addressing geographic variation and health inequalities (NHS England _ Neighbourhood health guidelines 2025_26.md).
     - **Gaps in Current Organisation Design Theme**: While "Organisation Design" might include elements of system integration, the specific focus on partnership and collaborative working might not be sufficiently detailed. A standalone theme or a more explicit focus within the existing theme could ensure that partnership working is prioritized and adequately resourced.

3. **Emerging Themes**:

   - **Digital Transformation and Technology Skills**:
     - **Evidence**: The NHS Long Term Workforce Plan and operational planning guidance both highlight the need for digital health competencies to support modern service delivery (priorities-and-operational-planning-guidance-january-2025.md, NHS England _ Planning framework for the NHS in England.md).
     - **Reason for Inclusion**: As healthcare increasingly relies on digital solutions, ensuring staff are equipped with the necessary skills is crucial for effective service delivery and innovation.

   - **Workforce Recovery from Pandemic**:
     - **Evidence**: The NHS Productivity Puzzle report discusses the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on workforce morale and productivity (NHS england Productivity.md).
     - **Reason for Inclusion**: Addressing pandemic recovery is essential for rebuilding workforce resilience and ensuring sustainable staffing levels.

   - **Retention and Career Progression**:
     - **Evidence**: The NHS People Plan emphasizes career progression as a key factor in retention, which is critical for maintaining a stable workforce (NHS England _ Planning framework for the NHS in England.md).
     - **Reason for Inclusion**: With ongoing workforce shortages, retention strategies and clear career pathways are vital for keeping skilled staff within the NHS.

   - **Equity and Health Disparities**:
     - **Evidence**: The Leeds Demographics Health Inequalities Context highlights significant health disparities that need to be addressed through targeted workforce deployment (Leeds_Demographics_Health_Inequalities_Context_2024.md).
     - **Reason for Inclusion**: Focusing on equity ensures that workforce strategies align with broader health goals and address systemic inequalities.

   - **New Roles and Career Pathways**:
     - **Evidence**: The NHS Long Term Workforce Plan suggests the development of advanced practice models and new roles to meet future healthcare demands (Assessment of priority skills to 2030 GOV UK.md).
     - **Reason for Inclusion**: As healthcare evolves, new roles and pathways will be essential for adapting to changing service needs and improving patient outcomes.

In summary, while the current strategy themes cover several important areas, integrating specific focuses on leadership, system partnership, and emerging themes such as digital transformation, workforce recovery, retention, equity, and new roles could enhance the strategy's effectiveness and alignment with national priorities.

### Organisation Design: Work in system partnership to implement Neighbourhood Health model

### 1. Strategic Alignment

**NHS 10-Year Plan Priorities:**
The Neighbourhood Health model aligns with the NHS 10-Year Plan by promoting integrated care, which is a key priority. The plan emphasizes the importance of collaboration across NHS, local government, and social care to deliver patient-centered care, particularly for those with complex health needs [Source: NHS England _ Neighbourhood health guidelines 2025_26.md].

**Leeds Health & Wellbeing Strategy Priorities:**
The Leeds Health & Wellbeing Strategy prioritizes reducing health inequalities and improving health outcomes across the city. The focus on supporting people with long-term health conditions in priority neighbourhoods aligns with these goals, as it aims to provide targeted interventions within the community [Source: Leeds_Demographics_Health_Inequalities_Context_2024.md].

**National Planning Guidance:**
The national planning guidance supports the implementation of integrated care models, highlighting the need for system-wide partnership and collaboration. It encourages the development of neighbourhood health models as part of a broader strategy to improve population health management and service delivery [Source: priorities-and-operational-planning-guidance-january-2025.md].

### 2. Current State

**LCH's Current Position:**
Leeds Community Healthcare (LCH) is actively engaged in developing neighbourhood health models, focusing on integrating services across health and social care. The LCH Trust Board has identified priority areas and is seeking funding to support these initiatives [Source: LCH-Trust-Board-Meeting-Public-Papers-4-09-2025-AMENDED _1_.md].

**Existing Evidence:**
Staff surveys indicate a positive response to collaborative working practices, though there are challenges in retention rates due to workload pressures. Evidence from local initiatives shows improved patient outcomes in areas where integrated care models have been implemented [Source: LCH-Trust-Board-Meeting-Public-Papers-4-09-2025-AMENDED _1_.md].

**Gap Analysis:**
The gap between the current and desired state includes the need for more robust data sharing mechanisms, increased funding, and enhanced workforce training to support integrated care delivery at scale [Source: LCH-Trust-Board-Meeting-Public-Papers-4-09-2025-AMENDED _1_.md].

### 3. Best Practice Evidence

**Approaches Working Elsewhere:**
Case studies from other regions demonstrate the effectiveness of multidisciplinary teams and area-based approaches in delivering integrated care. These models have shown success in improving patient satisfaction and reducing hospital admissions [Source: NHS England _ Neighbourhood health guidelines 2025_26.md].

**Supporting Evidence:**
The Fuller Stocktake highlights the importance of harnessing the skills of multidisciplinary teams to provide comprehensive care at the neighbourhood level. Evidence suggests that such teams can effectively manage complex patient needs and improve health outcomes [Source: NHS England _ Neighbourhood health guidelines 2025_26.md].

**Risks and Challenges:**
Documented challenges include potential resistance to change from staff, the complexity of aligning different organizational cultures, and the need for sustained funding to support long-term implementation [Source: NHS England _ Neighbourhood health guidelines 2025_26.md].

### 4. Implementation Considerations
