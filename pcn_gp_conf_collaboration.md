## Strategic Findings

**Traceability Legend**:
- **[FACT]** = Direct quote/data from source document
- **[SYNTHESIZED]** = Multiple facts combined into coherent insight
- **[INFERENCE]** = Strategic interpretation/implication

**Finding Title: Integrated Workforce Strategy through Employ/Deploy Model**

[SYNTHESIZED] The Leeds GP Confederation and Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust have developed an innovative Employ/Deploy model to manage workforce needs within Primary Care Networks (PCNs). This approach involves the Trust employing staff on behalf of PCNs, which are relatively new and may lack the infrastructure to manage staff employment themselves [Source2, Source18].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "In response to this and with Trust Board approval, within Workforce we developed our Employ and Deploy offer to in effect employ these staff on behalf of PCNs deploying them operationally to PCNs."
  → Workforce-Strategy-2021-25-V1.0.md

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] This model allows for greater flexibility and resource sharing across PCNs, enabling them to focus on operational functions without the administrative burden of employment. This can lead to more efficient service delivery and better resource utilization across the healthcare system.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: The Employ/Deploy model allows PCNs to function without managing employment logistics.
- ASSUMPTION: PCNs benefit from reduced administrative overhead.
- LOGIC: By centralizing employment, PCNs can focus on patient care and operational efficiency.

Caution: The model's success relies on effective coordination and communication between the Trust and PCNs. Any breakdown in this relationship could negate the benefits.

**Finding Title: Strategic Collaboration for Seamless Care Delivery**

[SYNTHESIZED] The Leeds Primary Healthcare Collaborative, consisting of Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust and the Leeds GP Confederation, aims to deliver seamless and efficient primary and community health services. This collaboration is part of a broader strategy to integrate services across different healthcare sectors [Source3, Source4].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "Leeds Primary Healthcare Collaborative, which is Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust and the Leeds GP Confederation whose aim is to jointly deliver city-wide seamless and efficient primary care and community health services for patients."
  → Leeds Community Annual-report-2024-2025.md

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] This integrated approach can enhance patient care by reducing fragmentation and ensuring a more coordinated response to patient needs. It supports the strategic goal of providing comprehensive care through partnerships.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: The Collaborative aims to deliver integrated services.
- ASSUMPTION: Integrated services lead to better patient outcomes.
- LOGIC: Joint efforts reduce service duplication and improve care continuity.

Caution: Success depends on maintaining strong partnerships and aligning priorities across organizations.

---

**Finding Title: Importance of Cross-Sector Collaboration**

[SYNTHESIZED] There is a growing emphasis on cross-sector collaboration involving primary care, social care, and community health to address complex healthcare needs more systematically. This approach is critical for supporting integrated care systems and improving public health outcomes [Source12, Source16].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "All parts of the health and care system – primary care, social care, community health, mental health, acute, and wider system partners – will need to work closely together to support people’s needs more systematically."
  → NHS England _ Neighbourhood health guidelines 2025_26.md

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] For workforce planning, this means developing roles and training programs that emphasize multi-disciplinary skills and collaboration. It also necessitates creating structures that facilitate seamless communication and coordination across sectors.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Cross-sector collaboration is emphasized in guidelines.
- ASSUMPTION: Effective collaboration improves health outcomes.
- LOGIC: Integrated roles and training can enhance system efficiency and patient care.

Caution: Implementing cross-sector collaboration requires overcoming bureaucratic and systemic barriers.

---

**Finding Title: Leveraging Technology for Integrated Care**

[SYNTHESIZED] The integration of digital systems across GP practices, social care, and other providers is crucial for effective care delivery. Compatible systems enable better case management, care navigation, and prioritization, supporting the work of multidisciplinary teams [Source8, Source12].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "Clinical data systems should have complementary functionality, including compatibility and integration between GP systems, digital social care records and other provider systems."
  → NHS England _ Neighbourhood health guidelines 2025_26.md

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] Strategic investment in technology infrastructure is essential for workforce planning. It ensures that staff can access and share information effectively, which is vital for coordinated care and efficient resource use.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Integrated systems are necessary for coordinated care.
- ASSUMPTION: Technology investments lead to improved care efficiency.
- LOGIC: Access to shared information enhances decision-making and patient outcomes.

Caution: Technology integration requires significant investment and ongoing maintenance, which must be carefully managed.

---

**Finding Title: Addressing Non-Medical Demand on Healthcare Services**

[SYNTHESIZED] A significant portion of GP appointments is occupied by non-medical issues, such as social or economic concerns. Addressing these through better integration with public services could reduce pressure on healthcare providers [Source20].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "Previous estimates suggest around 1 in 5 GP appointments are taken up for non-medical reasons, such as loneliness or to seek advice on housing or debts."
  → NHS England _ Neighbourhood health guidelines 2025_26.md

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] Workforce planning should consider roles that bridge healthcare and social services, such as social prescribing link workers. This can help redirect non-medical issues to appropriate services, freeing up GP time for medical care.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Non-medical issues occupy significant GP resources.
- ASSUMPTION: Social prescribing can effectively address non-medical issues.
- LOGIC: Redirecting non-medical cases reduces GP workload and improves care focus.

Caution: Success depends on the availability and accessibility of social services to handle redirected cases.

## Epistemic Analysis

Understanding what we **know** vs what we **assume** vs what we **infer**:

### Definitions
- **FACT**: Direct statement from authoritative source (verified data, published statistics, official statements)
- **ASSUMPTION**: Reasonable extrapolation based on trends or patterns (e.g., "turnover will remain at 15%")
- **INFERENCE**: Logical conclusion drawn from combining facts and/or assumptions (e.g., "therefore we need 750 recruits")

| Type | Count | Ratio |
|------|-------|-------|
| **FACT** | 2 | 10.0% |
| **ASSUMPTION** | 1 | 5% |
| **INFERENCE** | 17 | 85% |

**Quality Assessment**: [WARNING] Inference-heavy - findings based on interpretations rather than hard data. Recommend searching for official reports with verified statistics.

### Key Facts (Verified Data)

Found 2 verified facts from authoritative sources:

1. **Leeds Primary Healthcare Collaborative, which is Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust and the Leeds GP Confederation whose aim is to jointly deliver city-wide seamless and efficient primary care and community health services for patients.**
