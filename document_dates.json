  document_dates.json

  PURPOSE:
    Configuration file that stores publication/strategy dates for all documents.
    Used by ingest_pipeline.py and analyze_pipeline.py to track document recency
    and flag old/expiring strategic documents.

  USAGE:
    - Auto-generated by eval_dates.py
    - Read by ingest_pipeline.py (stores dates in ChromaDB metadata)
    - Read by analyze_pipeline.py (flags old/expiring documents in reports)

  STRUCTURE FOR EACH DOCUMENT:
    {
      "filename": {
        "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",           // Primary date (publication or fiscal year end)
        "source": "auto|manual|unknown", // How date was determined
        "year_range": ["YYYY", "YYYY"],  // For strategies: [start_year, end_year]
        "notes": "..."                   // Context about the date
      }
    }

  DATE PRIORITY (in order of preference):
    1. Published date (extracted from "Date published:" in content)
    2. Updated date (extracted from "Date updated:" in content)
    3. Fiscal year end (for annual reports - e.g., 2024 for FY 2023-2024)
    4. Strategy end date (for multi-year strategies - e.g., 2025 for 2021-2025)
    5. Manual entry (if no automatic extraction possible)

  WHEN TO UPDATE:
    - Run: python eval_dates.py
      (Generates initial document_dates.json from documents)
    - Run: python eval_dates.py --interactive
      (Allows you to confirm/override extracted dates)
    - Add new documents to docs/ and re-run eval_dates.py
    - Manually edit this file if dates need correction

  FLAGGING IN ANALYSIS OUTPUT:
    These flags appear in analyze_pipeline.py reports:
    - Documents >2 years old: [OLDER DOCUMENT - 2+ YEARS OLD]
    - Strategy ending in <1 year: [STRATEGY EXPIRES 2025 - USE WITH CAUTION]
    - Archival (>4 years): [ARCHIVAL - 4+ YEARS OLD]
    - No date: [NO DATE FOUND - VERIFY RELEVANCE]

  DATA FLOW:
    eval_dates.py → document_dates.json → ingest_pipeline.py → ChromaDB
                                       ↓
                       analyze_pipeline.py → Flagged reports
