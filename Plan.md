Understood. That is a critical distinction and a crucial clarification. Shifting the focus from "Leeds Community" to the entire **"Leeds Health and Care System"** significantly broadens the scope and elevates the strategic value of the platform.

The four-layer architecture we designed is not only still valid but becomes even more powerful and necessary to manage this increased complexity. It is designed to handle exactly this kind of system-level analysis.

I have updated the detailed specification to reflect this system-wide scope. The changes are integrated throughout the document to ensure the new focus is clear, consistent, and informs every layer of the architecture, from the data sources ingested to the types of strategic questions the agents will answer.

Here is the revised, more detailed specification.

# Technical Specification: Leeds Health and Care System Strategic Intelligence Platform
**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Author:** Gemini AI
**Project Lead:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1.0 Executive Summary
This document outlines the technical specification for the **Leeds Health and Care System Strategic Intelligence Platform**. This is a sophisticated system designed to ingest, analyze, and reason over the vast and varied data landscape of the entire Leeds health and care ecosystem. This includes primary care, acute hospital trusts, community services, mental health trusts, and public health bodies. The platform's core purpose is to move beyond siloed information retrieval to provide deep, actionable strategic insights into the functioning of the *entire system*, with a primary focus on identifying inter-service gaps, patient pathway frictions, strategic conflicts, and opportunities for integrated care improvement.

The architecture is built on four distinct layers: a **Data Ingestion & Enrichment Layer** to process diverse data sources from across the system; a **Foundational Knowledge Layer** utilizing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for searchable knowledge; a **Reasoning & Analysis Layer** powered by a multi-agent AI system for complex, system-level reasoning; and a **Presentation & Interaction Layer** offering both a proactive web portal and a reactive chatbot interface.

A non-negotiable principle of this platform is **absolute traceability**, ensuring every insight and conclusion is verifiably linked back to its source data, fostering high confidence and trust in the outputs for all system partners.

## 2.0 Core Problem Statement & Strategic Goals

### 2.1 Problem Statement
The Leeds Health and Care System is a complex network of independent yet interconnected organizations. Each partner generates a massive volume of data, including national policy documents, local trust board reports, Integrated Care Board (ICB) strategies, population health statistics, workforce data, and operational plans. This information is critical for system-wide strategic planning but is currently unwieldy, siloed, and difficult to synthesize. Manual analysis is time-consuming and struggles to identify the non-obvious, cross-cutting issues, such as patient flow blockages between acute and community care, conflicting investment priorities, or gaps in integrated care pathways.

### 2.2 Strategic Goals
The platform must achieve the following:
1.  **Create a Unified System-Wide Knowledge Base:** Ingest and unify a wide array of data from all major Leeds health and care partners into a single, searchable knowledge foundation.
2.  **Enable Integrated Care Analysis:** Answer complex, multi-faceted questions that require synthesizing information across primary, secondary, community, and mental health care domains.
3.  **Proactively Identify Systemic Gaps & Frictions:** Move beyond single-service analysis to actively highlight misalignments in strategy between partners, frictions in patient pathways, and gaps in service provision that exist *at the interfaces* of different organizations.
4.  **Ensure High Confidence & Traceability:** Every piece of generated analysis must be fully traceable to the specific source document(s), including page and section references, to ensure verification and build trust among all system partners.
5.  **Provide Accessible Interfaces:** Deliver insights through both a web-based intelligence portal for browsing and a conversational AI for bespoke, exploratory queries by system leaders.

## 3.0 System Architecture Overview
The platform is designed as a modular, four-layer system. This separation of concerns allows for independent development, scaling, and maintenance of each component.

1.  **Layer 1: Data Ingestion & Enrichment:** The pipeline for sourcing, cleaning, and metadata-tagging all incoming information from across the Leeds Health and Care System.
2.  **Layer 2: Foundational Knowledge Layer:** The core RAG system, featuring a vector database that makes all enriched data AI-ready.
3.  **Layer 3: Reasoning & Analysis Layer:** A multi-agent system that performs complex reasoning tasks using the knowledge layer as its primary tool.
4.  **Layer 4: Presentation & Interaction Layer:** The user-facing interfaces (web portal and chatbot) that consume the outputs of the reasoning layer.

## 4.0 Detailed Layer Specifications

### 4.1 Layer 1: Data Ingestion & Enrichment
*   **Purpose:** To create a standardized, reliable, and metadata-rich stream of data from all system partners to feed the knowledge layer. This layer is the foundation for all subsequent traceability.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Data Connectors:** Scripts to fetch data from a wide variety of sources, including:
        *   **Public Websites:** Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (for board reports, annual plans).
        *   **National Sources:** NHS England, NICE (for policy and guidance).
        *   **Local Government:** Leeds City Council (for public health data, social care plans).
        *   **System-Level Bodies:** West Yorkshire Integrated Care Board (for system strategy).
        *   **Internal Sources:** Connectors for internal databases (e.g., population health data) and file shares.
    *   **Document Parser & Data Cleaning:** As previously specified.
    *   **Metadata Enrichment Engine:** This becomes even more critical in a multi-partner environment.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   Support for all previously listed file formats.
    *   For every ingested document, the following metadata **must** be extracted or generated:
        *   `source_document`
        *   `publication_date`
        *   `ingestion_date`
        *   **`source_organization` (Critical New Field):** (e.g., "LTHT", "LCH", "WYICB", "LCC").
        *   **`system_pillar` (Critical New Field):** (e.g., "Acute Care", "Community Care", "Primary Care", "Mental Health", "Public Health", "System Strategy").
        *   `data_type` (e.g., "Board Report", "Clinical Guideline", "Financial Plan").
        *   `geography` (e.g., "Leeds", "West Yorkshire", "National").
        *   `domain` (auto-tagged, e.g., "Workforce", "Finance", "Patient Safety").
        *   `document_section` or `page_number`.

### 4.2 Layer 2: Foundational Knowledge Layer (RAG Core)
*   **Purpose:** To index all enriched data from Layer 1, making it efficiently searchable and retrievable for AI models.
*   **Key Components:** As previously specified.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   **Multi-Representation Indexing:** This remains a core requirement.
    *   **Metadata Filtering:** The retriever must provide robust filtering on the new `source_organization` and `system_pillar` fields. This is essential to ask questions like, *"Compare the workforce retention strategies from the Acute and Community trusts."*
    *   **Scalability:** The Vector Store solution must be chosen with the understanding that the data volume will be significantly larger than for a single service area.

### 4.3 Layer 3: Reasoning & Analysis Layer (Multi-Agent System)
*   **Purpose:** To orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents to perform complex, multi-step reasoning that reflects the interconnected nature of the Leeds Health and Care System.
*   **Framework Selection:** As previously specified (CrewAI or LangGraph).
*   **Agent Roles & Responsibilities:** The agent roles are expanded to reflect the system-wide scope.
    *   **1. Orchestrator Agent (System Integrator):**
        *   **Purpose:** Receives high-level system-wide goals, such as *"Analyze the pressures on urgent and emergency care in Leeds by examining demand, capacity, and patient flow data from the acute trust, community response teams, and primary care."* It then creates a plan and delegates to the specialist agents.
    *   **2. Research Analyst Agent:**
        *   **Purpose:** As before, this agent queries the RAG layer. It is now an expert at using the `source_organization` and `system_pillar` metadata filters to retrieve and compare information from different parts of the system.
    *   **3. Patient Pathway Analyst Agent (New Specialist):**
        *   **Purpose:** To trace specific patient cohorts across different services.
        *   **Task Example:** The Orchestrator might ask, *"Trace the pathway for an elderly patient discharged from LTHT following a fall. What services are mentioned in the community trust's discharge plans, and what are the stated waiting times or capacity constraints?"*
    *   **4. The Gap Analyst Agent ("System Red Team"):**
        *   **Purpose:** This agent's role is elevated to find systemic frictions and gaps *between* organizations.
        *   **Prompting:** Its prompt is tuned for system-level thinking: *"You are a skeptical and experienced system transformation director. Your job is to identify gaps, misalignments, and frictions *between* the different parts of the Leeds Health and Care system based on the provided data. Where do the stated priorities of different trusts conflict? Where are the blockages in patient pathways? What are the unaddressed dependencies between services?"*
        *   **Output Example:** "A gap has been identified: The Acute Trust's 'Discharge to Assess' policy aims for a 24-hour discharge, but the Community Trust's operational plan indicates an average 72-hour wait time for a community therapy assessment, creating a significant patient flow bottleneck. [Sources: LTHT Board Report, pg 12; LCH Operational Plan, pg 8]."

### 4.4 Layer 4: Presentation & Interaction Layer
*   **Purpose:** To provide intuitive interfaces for system leaders to access the platform's insights.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **1. Proactive Intelligence Portal:**
        *   **Description:** The portal will feature dashboards focused on system-level issues.
        *   **Dashboard Examples:** "System-Wide Patient Flow," "Integrated Care Pathway Performance," "Comparison of Strategic Priorities Across Trusts," "Identified System Gaps & Conflicts."
        *   **Traceability:** Inline citations remain a non-negotiable feature.
    *   **2. Reactive Chatbot Interface:**
        *   **Description:** The chatbot will now act as an expert on the entire Leeds system.
        *   **Example Query:** A user from the ICB could ask, *"What are the common themes in the 'workforce challenges' sections of the most recent board reports from the three largest trusts in Leeds?"* The agent would then execute this multi-source synthesis in real-time.

## 5.0 Phased Development Roadmap
The roadmap remains logically consistent, but the scope of each phase is now larger.

*   **Phase 1: Foundation & Ingestion:** This phase is now more complex and will require establishing data-sharing agreements or connectors for multiple organizations. The initial corpus should include key strategic documents from at least the main Acute, Community, and Mental Health trusts.
*   **Phase 2: The Reasoning Engine:** Development can proceed as planned, with agent prompts and logic being tailored to the system-level questions.
*   **Phase 3: User Interfaces:** Development can proceed as planned, with dashboard designs reflecting the system-wide focus.
*   **Phase 4: Scale & Iterate:** Scaling will involve bringing more partners and more niche data sources into the platform (e.g., primary care data, third-sector provider reports).
