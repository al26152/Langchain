### Q01: Summarise the 10 year plan

**Answer:**
The 10-Year Health Plan is a strategic framework aimed at transforming the organization, delivery, and funding of health services in England to address the evolving needs of the population. This plan emphasizes the necessity for a new planning model to effectively meet these challenges and lays the groundwork for significant service transformation [Source: NHS England _ Planning framework for the NHS in England.md].

One of the core elements of the plan is the focus on upstream interventions, which are critical for achieving the Five-Year Plan's goals. These interventions aim to ensure that individuals receive the best start in life and have the opportunity to maintain their health and age well [Source: NHS England Board Meeting – 23 September 2025.txt]. This approach underscores the importance of preventive measures and early interventions as foundational strategies for long-term health improvement.

The plan also outlines three strategic "shifts" that are central to its implementation, emphasizing a relentless focus on improvement and innovation. It highlights the importance of not pausing in efforts to improve current services while simultaneously building a better future [Source: priorities-and-operational-planning-guidance-january-2025.md]. These shifts are expected to drive the transformation needed to maximize value for both patients and taxpayers, aligning closely with the broader objectives of the 10-Year Health Plan [Source: NHS england Productivity.md].

In summary, the 10-Year Health Plan is a comprehensive strategy that seeks to realign the health system to better serve the population through innovative planning, upstream health interventions, and strategic improvements, ensuring a sustainable and effective healthcare system for the future.

### Q02: Pick out the key focus areas for Leeds Community Healthcare based on the 10 year plan, Leeds Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2023, and Neighbourhood health guides

**Answer:**
The key focus areas for Leeds Community Healthcare, as outlined in the 10-year plan, the Leeds Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2023, and the Neighbourhood health guidelines, are centered around addressing health inequalities, enhancing community-based care, and fostering collaborative partnerships.

1. **Addressing Health Inequalities**: A significant focus is on improving health outcomes for the 26% of the population living in the most deprived areas of Leeds. The Leeds Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2023 aims to enable people to live fulfilling lives in a healthy city with equitable services [Source: leeds health wellbeing strategy 2023-2030.md]. This aligns with the strategic goal of the Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to improve the health and lives of communities served from 2025 to 2030 [Source: LYPFT Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2024-25.md].

2. **Community-Based Care and Neighbourhood Model**: The Neighbourhood health guidelines emphasize the implementation of a community collaborative model, focusing on areas like Home First Phase 2, community mental health transformation, and early identification of cardiovascular disease. This model targets the complex needs of 2-4% of the population in Leeds and aims to support people with long-term health conditions in priority neighborhoods [Source: NHS England _ Neighbourhood health guidelines 2025_26.md]. The alignment of these priority areas with Primary Care Networks is crucial for effective service delivery [Source: LCH-Trust-Board-Meeting-Public-Papers-4-09-2025-AMENDED _1_.md].

3. **Collaborative Partnerships and Workforce Planning**: The Leeds Health and Care Partnership, including Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, emphasizes system-wide partnerships to deliver the neighborhood health model and other strategic drivers outlined in the 10-year plan. This involves innovative service models and targeted workforce deployment to meet the needs of a diverse and changing population, including a growing elderly demographic [Source: Leeds_Demographics_Health_Inequalities_Context_2024.md]. The partnership approach is crucial for achieving the shared national ambitions of the NHS as set out in the 10-Year Health Plan [Source: NHS England _ Planning framework for the NHS in England.md].

Overall, these focus areas demonstrate a commitment to addressing health disparities, enhancing community care, and leveraging partnerships for sustainable healthcare delivery in Leeds.

### Q04: The strategy may cover Leadership, People Services, Inclusion, Talent, Staff Experience and Organisational Design - are there any missing focus areas?

**Answer:**
Based on the analysis of multiple documents, the strategy appears to cover several critical areas such as Leadership, People Services, Inclusion, Talent, Staff Experience, and Organisational Design. However, there are additional focus areas that could be considered to enhance the comprehensiveness of the strategy.

1. **Digital & Technology Integration**: The importance of digital and technology as an enabler is emphasized across the strategy. This focus aims to leverage technology to improve workforce systems and intelligence, as well as enhance service delivery and accessibility [Source: Workforce-Strategy-2021-25-V1.0.md]. This suggests that a more explicit focus on digital transformation could be beneficial, ensuring that technological advancements are fully integrated into all aspects of workforce management and service delivery.

2. **Employee Voice and Engagement**: While the strategy mentions Employee Voice as an enabler, it could be expanded into a standalone focus area. Engaging employees in decision-making processes and ensuring their voices are heard can significantly impact job satisfaction and productivity [Source: Public Sector CIPD Report.md]. This aligns with the need for impactful health and well-being interventions to engage and motivate staff, as noted in the context [Source: LCH-Trust-Board-Meeting-Public-Papers-4-09-2025-AMENDED _1_.md].

3. **Health and Well-being**: Although health and well-being are mentioned, they could be more prominently featured as a distinct focus area. The interplay between employee engagement, leadership, and well-being is crucial for maintaining a productive workforce. The strategy could benefit from a more detailed approach to health and well-being initiatives, particularly in light of the challenges highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic [Source: Leeds Coommunity Annual Report 2324.md].

In conclusion, while the existing strategy covers essential areas, expanding on digital transformation, employee engagement, and health and well-being could further strengthen its effectiveness and ensure it addresses all critical aspects of workforce management.

### Q05: What are the current staffing turnover rates, joiner/leaver patterns and headcount trends for Leeds Community Healthcare?

**Answer:**
The current staffing turnover rates, joiner/leaver patterns, and headcount trends for Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust can be synthesized from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive overview.

Firstly, according to the "Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust NHS Staff Survey Benchmark report 2024," the Trust has been analyzing its staff turnover rates in the context of similar organizations. The document highlights that the Trust faces a possible obligation arising from its employ and deploy model of staffing, which affects turnover and deployment strategies [Source: Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust NHS Staff Survey Benchmark report 2024.md].

Secondly, the "Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust 2024 NHS Staff Survey Breakdown Report" provides specific data on joiner and leaver rates across various staff groups. Notably, the overall joiner rate is 8%, while the leaver rate is 12%. This indicates a net decrease in staffing levels. For instance, nurses and health visitors have a joiner rate of 9% and a leaver rate of 11%, highlighting a slightly higher turnover in this critical group [Source: Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust 2024 NHS Staff Survey Breakdown Report.md].

Lastly, the "Leeds Community Annual-report-2024-2025" emphasizes the challenges posed by demographic changes in Leeds, such as a growing elderly population and significant health inequalities, which necessitate strategic workforce planning. This demographic context influences headcount trends and necessitates innovative service models to address the complex care needs of the population [Source: Leeds Community Annual-report-2024-2025.md].

In summary, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust is experiencing a higher leaver rate compared to joiner rate, particularly among nurses and health visitors, indicating a need for strategic workforce interventions. The demographic shifts in Leeds further complicate staffing needs, requiring targeted workforce deployment to address the growing demand for complex community care services.
