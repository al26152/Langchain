# Test Workflow Summary
**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Activity:** Comprehensive Strategic Planning Analysis Test
**Status:** COMPLETE & ANALYZED

## What We Did

You asked to test your existing Wide-Then-Deep workflow with a detailed, complex prompt to see how it performs with real-world strategic planning requirements.

### The Test

**Prompt Used:** Multi-dimensional organizational strategic planning framework

   - Prevented wasted iterations

### What Needs Improvement ✗

1. **Output Length** (MAJOR GAP)
   - Current: 6,765 characters
   - Baseline Standard: 67,500 characters
   - **Gap: System produces 1/10th of required depth**

2. **Missing Sections**
   - ✗ Assumptions Register (confidence levels, FACT/INFERENCE/ASSUMPTION)
   - ✗ Detailed Executive Summary (should be 1,000+ words)
   - ✗ Strategic Context Assessment section
   - ✗ SWOT Analysis (Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats)
   - ✗ Data Quality Assessment section
   - ✗ Resource Requirements & ROI Analysis

3. **Confidence Frameworks**
   - Lacks explicit confidence level assignment (85-90%, 70-80%, 50-60%)
   - No documented data gaps and handling approaches
   - No methodology transparency section

4. **Source Coverage**
   - Used 7 of 30 documents (23%)
   - Could push toward higher coverage
   - Selected 15 but consulted only 7

## Detailed Comparison to Baseline Standard

### Output Structure

**Current System:**
```
1. Introduction (implicit in findings)
2. 5 Strategic Findings (6,765 chars total)
3. Confidence Assessment (basic metrics)
4. Full Report
```

**Baseline Standard:**
```
1. ASSUMPTIONS REGISTER (2,500 words) ← MISSING
2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1,000 words) ← TOO SHORT
3. SECTION 1: Current State Profile
4. SECTION 2: Strategic Context Assessment ← MISSING
5. SECTION 3: SWOT Analysis ← MISSING
6. SECTION 4: Priority Areas for Development ← WEAK
7. SECTION 5: Data Quality Assessment ← MISSING
8. Appendices (references, dashboards)
```

### Output Depth

**Per Finding:**
- Current: 250-350 words per finding
- Baseline: 1,500-2,000 words per finding per finding
- **Gap: Each finding should be 5-8x deeper**

### Confidence Framework

**Current System:**
- Overall: 70% confidence (good/adequate rating)
- No granular confidence levels
- No explicit FACT/INFERENCE/ASSUMPTION separation

**Baseline Standard:**
- HIGH: 85-90% confidence (with reasoning)
- MEDIUM: 70-80% confidence (with reasoning)
- LOWER: 50-60% confidence (with reasoning)
- Each claim explicitly classified

## Path Forward

Based on the test results, the roadmap to reach baseline standard is clear:

### Phase 1: Integrate Existing Agents (Already Built)
- AssumptionsRegisterAgent (281 lines) - ready to integrate
- DataQualityAgent (370 lines) - ready to integrate
- **Time:** 2-3 hours

### Phase 2: Create Missing Agent
- SWOTAgent (evidence-based SWOT analysis generator)
- **Time:** 2-3 hours

### Phase 3: Enhance SynthesisAgent
- Extend executive summary (1,000+ words)
- Add strategic context section
- Add SWOT analysis integration
- Enhance priority areas with resource/ROI
- **Time:** 4-6 hours

### Phase 4: Update Orchestrator
- Add run_baseline_analysis() method
- Coordinate all agents in correct sequence
- Build complete 8-section report
- **Time:** 2-3 hours

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
- Run end-to-end test
- Verify all sections generated
- Check output matches baseline (67,500+ chars)
- Regenerate previous analyses with new system
- **Time:** 2-3 hours

**Total Estimated Effort:** 11-17 hours (1-2 working days of focused development)

**Expected Outcome:** 10x improvement in output depth and strategic value

## Summary

You tested your existing Wide-Then-Deep workflow with a complex, multi-dimensional strategic planning prompt. The system performed well (70% confidence, GOOD rating) and successfully handled all three planning dimensions and five strategic shifts.

However, to match the baseline standard you specified, the system needs significant enhancement in depth and comprehensiveness (10x increase in output length with additional sections like Assumptions Register, SWOT Analysis, and Data Quality Assessment).

The good news: The path forward is clear, two critical agents are already built, and the estimated work is 11-17 hours to achieve production-ready baseline-compliant system.

**All necessary components are in place. Ready to build when you give the go-ahead.**
