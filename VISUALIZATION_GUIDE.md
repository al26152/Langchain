## Creating Custom Visualizations

### For Specific Entities

Use the `visualize_entity_network.py` script:

```bash
# Visualize a single organization
python visualize_entity_network.py LTHT

# Visualize multiple organizations
python visualize_entity_network.py LTHT LCH LYPFT

# Use full names
python visualize_entity_network.py "Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"

# Focus on a service
python visualize_entity_network.py "Elective Care"

# Explore pathways
python visualize_entity_network.py "Discharge to Assessment (D2A) pathways"
```

**Output**: `entity_network.html` (overwrites each time)

### For Organization Networks

Use the `visualize_org_focused.py` script:

```bash
python visualize_org_focused.py
```

**Output**: `org_network.html` (clean strategic view)

## Key Insights from the Visualizations

### Finding #1: Hub Organizations

**Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust (LCH)** is a major hub:
- Connected to **100+ services**
- Uses **multiple pathways** (D2A, Community Care, Primary Care)
- Collaborates with **Leeds City Council** (Homefirst initiative)
- Member of **West Yorkshire Community Health Services Provider Collaborative**

### Finding #2: Critical Pathways

**Discharge to Assessment (D2A) pathways** connect multiple organizations:
- Used by LCH
- Mentioned alongside LTHT acute services
- Critical for elective care flow (as we discovered in the analysis!)

### Finding #3: System-Wide Collaboratives

**West Yorkshire Community Health Services Provider Collaborative**:
- Includes 8 community providers
- LCH is a key member
- Enables resource sharing across trusts

**Mental Health, Learning Disabilities, and Autism Collaborative**:
- Cross-organization partnership
- Connects LYPFT with other trusts

### Finding #4: The "Mentioned Together" Network

The most common relationship is `mentioned_together_in` (328 instances):
- Shows which entities are discussed together in documents
- Reveals implicit connections not explicitly stated
- Example: LTHT + "Elective Operations" + "Discharge pathways" appear together frequently

## Technical Details

### Visualization Technology
- **Library**: vis.js (network visualization)
- **Format**: Standalone HTML (no server needed)
- **Data source**: `knowledge_graph_improved.json`

### Performance
- **Large networks** (19K relationships): May take 10-30 seconds to stabilize
- **Medium networks** (400 relationships): 2-5 seconds
- **Small networks** (40 entities): Instant

**Tip**: Click "Toggle Physics" to freeze the layout once it's stabilized

### Customization

Want to change colors or layout? Edit the visualization scripts:
- `visualize_entity_network.py` (lines 110-140) - Node colors/sizes
- `visualize_org_focused.py` (lines 60-90) - Color scheme

Then re-run the script to regenerate.

## Comparison: Knowledge Graph vs Multi-Agent RAG

### Knowledge Graph Visualization
‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Visual understanding of system structure
- Discover implicit connections
- Strategic planning tool
- No API costs (static graph)

‚ùå **Limitations:**
- Shows relationships, not evidence quality
- Can't answer "why" questions
- May miss nuanced context

### Multi-Agent RAG (KG-Enhanced)
‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Uses KG to expand searches
- Provides evidence with confidence scores
- Answers complex questions
- Epistemic tagging (FACT/ASSUMPTION/INFERENCE)

‚ùå **Limitations:**
- Costs $0.15-0.40 per query
- Harder to see full system structure

### Best Practice: Use Both Together

1. **Start with visualization** ‚Üí Understand system structure
2. **Form questions** ‚Üí Based on what you see
3. **Run multi-agent query** ‚Üí Get evidence-based answers
4. **Return to visualization** ‚Üí Validate findings visually

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Open org_network.html
2. See LTHT connected to "Elective Operations"
3. Question: "What elective care challenges does LTHT face?"
4. Run: python analysis/multi_agent/run_multi_agent.py --question "..."
5. Review evidence (85% confidence, 8 sources)
6. Return to visualization to see pathway connections
```
