# Session Summary - Ready for Tomorrow

## Cleanup Completed ✓

All development and test files have been removed. Your project is now clean and production-ready.

---

## What's Kept (Production Ready)

### Python Scripts
```
✓ build_knowledge_graph_framework.py    - Main extraction script (RECOMMENDED)
✓ clean_duplicate_organizations.py      - Organization cleanup utility
✓ visualize_balanced.py                 - Visualization script
✓ run_full_pipeline.py                  - Full pipeline runner
```

### Data & Outputs
```
✓ knowledge_graph_improved.json         - Final cleaned knowledge graph (4.7M)
✓ knowledge_graph_cleaned_visualization.html  - Interactive visualization
```

### Documentation
```
✓ FRAMEWORK_APPROACH_SUMMARY.md         - Framework details
✓ RAG_AND_METADATA_ANALYSIS.md          - RAG implementation details
✓ SCALABILITY_ANALYSIS.md               - Why framework approach scales
✓ README.md                             - Project overview
✓ Leeds_Community_Healthcare_AI_Writing_Style_Guide.md
✓ Workforce_Strategy_2026-2031_Gap_Analysis_Report_LCH_Complete.md

## What Was Removed (Development/Test)

Deleted 25+ files including:
- Old version scripts (v2, v3)
- Test approaches (explicit, context-aware)
- Analysis scripts (15+ scripts)
- Test JSON outputs
- Old visualizations
- Old analysis markdown files
- Log files and temporary directories

---

## Key Findings Summary

### Framework-Based Approach is Scalable

The **build_knowledge_graph_framework.py** is the recommended approach because:

1. **Universal Framework Queries** - Works for any healthcare organization
   - `"community health services"`
   - `"mental health services"`
   - NOT `"Leeds Community adult services"` (org-specific, doesn't scale)

2. **Automatic Metadata Context** - No hardcoding needed
   - ChromaDB automatically stores document source
   - LLM uses that context automatically
   - Works the same for any organization

3. **Results**
   - 16 organizations extracted
   - 115 services identified
   - 88 explicit relationships (after cleanup)
   - LCH: 53 services, LTHT: 9 services, LYPFT: 3 services

### RAG + Metadata in Use ✓
- RAG: Semantic search on ChromaDB with framework queries
- Metadata: Document source passed as context to LLM
- Scalable: Same approach for any healthcare system

## How to Continue Tomorrow

### Run the Main Extraction
```bash
cd "C:\Users\al261\OneDrive\Documents\Langchain"
.venv\Scripts\python build_knowledge_graph_framework.py
```

### Clean Up Duplicates (if needed)
```bash
.venv\Scripts\python clean_duplicate_organizations.py
```

### Visualize Results
```bash
.venv\Scripts\python visualize_balanced.py
```

### Run Full Pipeline
```bash
.venv\Scripts\python run_full_pipeline.py
```

## Important Files to Read

1. **SCALABILITY_ANALYSIS.md** - Understanding why framework approach is best
2. **RAG_AND_METADATA_ANALYSIS.md** - How RAG and metadata are used
3. **FRAMEWORK_APPROACH_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed framework explanation

## Current Knowledge Graph Status

**File**: knowledge_graph_improved.json

**Statistics**:
- Total entities: 211 (after cleanup)
- Total relationships: 19,374
- Explicit relationships: 88
- Implicit relationships: 19,286

**Organizations** (after cleanup):
- Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust: 53 services
- Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust: 9 services
- Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust: 3 services
- Others: 13 organizations

**Services**: 115 unique services

**Visualization**: knowledge_graph_cleaned_visualization.html (interactive)

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

Decide on:
1. Further entity deduplication (merge organization variants)?
2. Improve LYPFT service extraction (currently only 3)?
3. Analyze specific care pathways between organizations?
4. Export data for downstream analysis?
5. Add new organizations' documents to test scalability?

---

**Session End**: All production files cleaned and organized. Ready for fresh start tomorrow with clear, minimal codebase.
