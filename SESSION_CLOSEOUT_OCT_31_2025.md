  - All 3 planning dimensions addressed
  - Executive summary opens with appreciation for colleagues (per style guide)
  - Community-centered language throughout
  - Evidence-based strategic findings

### 3. System Validation
**Key Findings:**

**What Worked Excellently:**
- ✅ 4-phase architecture sound and efficient
- ✅ Web Lookup correctly identifies themes
- ✅ Document Selection intelligently filters corpus
- ✅ Evidence Retrieval efficiently converges
- ✅ Synthesis generates traceable findings
- ✅ Organization-specific ranking effective
- ✅ All strategic shifts identified (100% coverage)
- ✅ All planning dimensions covered (100% coverage)
- ✅ Writing style application successful

## Technical Observations

### System Architecture
- **Phase 1 (Web Lookup):** Identifies themes and creates validation framework
- **Phase 2 (Document Selection):** Filters corpus intelligently (50% reduction)
- **Phase 3 (Evidence Retrieval):** Multi-iteration search with convergence detection
- **Phase 4 (Synthesis):** Generates structured findings with evidence classification

### Organization Ranking Feature
System successfully uses organization-specific ranking:
```
[ORG RANK] Primary organization: Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust
[ORG RANK] Using ranking (org-specific first, then strategic context, then general)
```
This effectively eliminates confusion with related organizations (e.g., Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust) and prioritizes relevant documents.

### Performance Metrics
| Metric | Generic Test | LCH Analysis |
|--------|---|---|
| Confidence | 70% | 70% |
| Quality | GOOD | ADEQUATE |
| Iterations | 2 | 2 |
| Sources Used | 7 of 30 | 5 of 30 |
| Coverage | 23% | 17% |
| Time | 23 sec | 25 sec |
| Output Size | 6.7K chars | 26.2K chars |
| Strategic Shifts | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Dimensions | 3/3 | 3/3 |

## Decisions Made

### What NOT to Do
1. ❌ **Assumptions Register Agent Integration** - Deferred
   - Pre-built agent available but not integrated
   - User decision: Focus on core workflow validation first

2. ❌ **Data Quality Agent Integration** - Deferred
   - Pre-built agent available but not integrated
   - User decision: Focus on core workflow validation first

3. ❌ **SWOT Agent Creation** - Deferred
   - Would add Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats analysis
   - User decision: Out of scope for this session

### Why These Decisions
- Session focus was on **validating existing workflow**, not enhancing it
- User preference: Complete testing phase before beginning enhancement phase
- Baseline-standard pursuit deferred to future session
