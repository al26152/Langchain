## Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust

**Report Date:** 21 October 2025
**Analysis Status:** Complete with Macro-Context Integration

---

## Introduction and Executive Context

We are pleased to present this comprehensive gap analysis of our proposed Workforce Strategy 2026-2031. This analysis has been developed through rigorous examination of our strategic priorities against the broader macro-context in which we operate – including emerging labour market trends, health and wellbeing developments, government policy directions, and technological transformation imperatives.

This work represents the collaborative effort of our strategic planning team and reflects our commitment to building a workforce strategy that serves the people of Leeds. Our analysis assesses five core strategic themes against political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors – recognising that effective workforce planning must account for the complex landscape we navigate.

Everything we propose is designed with our Golden Thread in mind: attracting, developing, and keeping the best people, in order to deliver outstanding care to our communities.

---

## Executive Summary

Our proposed Workforce Strategy 2026-2031 comprises five core themes:

1. **People Services** – Standardisation, efficiency, NHS systems alignment
2. **Inclusion** – Data-driven interventions, inclusive practices
3. **Talent** – 10-Year Plan objectives, pipelines, recruitment efficiency
4. **Staff Experience** – Engagement, wellbeing, staff benefits
5. **Organisation Design** – Neighbourhood health model, system partnership

This analysis tests these themes and objectives against:

- PESTLE factors (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental)
- Cross-cutting macro-themes that influence multiple areas simultaneously
- Evidence from multiple sources including NHS strategic documents, labour market forecasting, skills data, and local Leeds health priorities
- Current gaps between our aspirations and emerging workforce demands

Our findings suggest that whilst the proposed themes are fundamentally sound and well-aligned with NHS priorities, there are important gaps where greater ambition, clarity, and integration would strengthen our strategy for 2026-2031.

## Section 1: Macro-Context Analysis – The Landscape We Operate Within

Before examining specific strategy themes, we have analysed the broader context shaping workforce strategy effectiveness. This landscape analysis reveals six critical external factors and five cross-cutting themes that must inform our approach.

### Part A: External Factors Analysis (PESTLE)

#### Political Factor

The political dimension encompasses government priorities, system integration requirements, and the evolving Integrated Care Systems (ICS) leadership landscape [1]. In the UK healthcare context, the NHS is fundamentally shaped by government policy, which directs performance management, employment practices, and staff deployment [2].

**Strategic Implications for LCH:**

We have opportunities to leverage government workforce development initiatives and system integration goals, which can enhance patient care and operational efficiency. However, policy shifts and regulatory constraints may impact funding and workforce planning [3].

Key political considerations:
- Integration across healthcare systems through ICS governance
- System interoperability requirements for seamless care delivery
- Changing employment regulations and working arrangements [1]

**Gaps in Current Objectives:** Our People Services and Organisation Design themes could more explicitly address system integration requirements and ICS leadership development [4].

#### Economic Factor

The economic dimension encompasses labour market competitiveness, salary dynamics, funding constraints, and cost-benefit efficiency [5]. The NHS operates within significant financial pressures, with funding constraints limiting our ability to compete for skilled professionals in an increasingly competitive market [6].

**Strategic Implications for LCH:**

We face opportunities to innovate in workforce management through partnerships and technology adoption. However, funding pressures pose real challenges to our ability to attract and retain skilled professionals, particularly in competitive specialties [7].

Key economic pressures:
- Significant NHS budget pressures anticipated through 2025-26 and beyond
- Labour market competition for healthcare professionals
- Need for cost-effective staffing models and innovation [8]

**Gaps in Current Objectives:** Our Talent and Staff Experience themes would benefit from more explicit strategies addressing salary competitiveness and retention in a challenging funding environment [9].

#### Social Factor

The social dimension reflects demographic shifts, health disparities, workforce expectations, retention challenges, and wellbeing trends [10]. Leeds faces significant demographic variation, with an ageing population and areas of considerable health inequality [11].

**Strategic Implications for LCH:**

We have opportunities to innovate in service delivery for preventive and early intervention care, and to attract diverse talent through inclusive practices. However, demographic pressures and workforce expectations around flexibility and wellbeing require targeted strategies [12].

Key social factors:
- Demographic shifts including an ageing population requiring complex care services
- Health inequalities concentrated in specific Leeds communities
- Workforce expectations for flexibility, work-life balance, and wellbeing support [11]

**Gaps in Current Objectives:** Our Inclusion and Staff Experience themes could more comprehensively address health disparities, targeted workforce deployment, and the wellbeing crisis facing healthcare staff [13].

#### Technological Factor

The technological dimension encompasses digital transformation, legacy systems modernisation, emerging tech skills, artificial intelligence and automation, and system interoperability [14]. The NHS is navigating rapid technological change whilst managing existing systems and infrastructure [15].

**Strategic Implications for LCH:**

We have significant opportunities to improve efficiency and patient outcomes through digital transformation, AI applications, and better interoperability. However, skill gaps, legacy systems, and the pace of technological change present challenges [16].

Key technological factors:
- Need for rapid digital transformation and emerging tech skills development
- Integration of artificial intelligence and automation into healthcare delivery
- System interoperability requirements across NHS organisations
- Ongoing challenges with legacy systems [17]

**Gaps in Current Objectives:** Our People Services and Organisation Design themes could more explicitly address digital transformation, emerging skills needs, and system interoperability requirements [18].

#### Legal Factor

The legal dimension includes employment law, working time regulations, professional standards, data protection, and compliance requirements [19]. The NHS operates within a highly regulated environment with nationally determined terms and conditions [20].

**Strategic Implications for LCH:**

We must ensure compliance with employment law, professional standards, and data protection regulations. Opportunities exist to strengthen our commitment to equitable and inclusive employment practices, though regulatory constraints may limit workforce management flexibility [21].

Key legal factors:
- Working time regulations and their impact on shift patterns and service planning
- Professional standards and continuing professional development requirements
- Data protection and cybersecurity compliance obligations
- Employment law compliance and trade union engagement [22]

**Gaps in Current Objectives:** Our strategy would benefit from more explicit attention to legal compliance, professional standards development, and data protection requirements [23].

#### Environmental Factor

The environmental dimension encompasses the NHS net zero commitment (2040 target), sustainability skills development, pandemic preparedness, and workplace environment considerations [24]. The NHS has made significant commitments to environmental sustainability [25].

**Strategic Implications for LCH:**

We have opportunities to lead in sustainability practices and position LCH as an employer of choice on environmental grounds. However, implementing sustainability initiatives requires investment and workforce capability development [26].

Key environmental factors:
- NHS net zero commitment requiring emissions reductions across all operations
- Need for sustainability skills and green practice adoption throughout the workforce
- Pandemic preparedness and flexible workplace arrangements
- Workplace environment quality affecting staff wellbeing and retention [27]

**Gaps in Current Objectives:** Our strategy would be strengthened by explicit integration of sustainability skills development, pandemic preparedness, and environmental commitments across all themes [28].

### Part B: Cross-Cutting Macro-Themes

Five themes cut across multiple PESTLE dimensions and require integration across all strategy areas.

#### Digital Transformation

Digital transformation spans all PESTLE factors and fundamentally influences how we deliver care and manage our workforce. The evidence is compelling: organisations successfully integrating digital solutions show improved efficiency, better patient outcomes, and enhanced staff experience [29].

**Why This Matters Across All Themes:**

- **People Services:** Digital tools streamline HR processes and improve workforce management through data analytics
- **Inclusion:** Digital platforms make services more accessible, particularly for disadvantaged groups
- **Talent:** Digital skills are now essential for all healthcare roles, requiring comprehensive development programmes
- **Staff Experience:** Digital tools reduce administrative burdens and enable flexible working
- **Organisation Design:** Digital integration is fundamental to system-wide transformation and neighbourhood health models [30]

**Current Gaps:** Whilst we recognise digital importance, our objectives would benefit from clearer targets for digital literacy, infrastructure investment, and emerging technology skills development across all staff levels [31].

#### Health and Wellbeing Crisis

Post-pandemic, the NHS faces significant challenges with staff burnout, mental health concerns, and retention difficulties. This affects every aspect of our organisation and workforce strategy [32].

**Why This Matters Across All Themes:**

- **People Services:** Enhanced support systems and resources are needed to address staff wellbeing
- **Inclusion:** Burnout disproportionately affects underrepresented groups, requiring targeted support
- **Talent:** High turnover and burnout disrupts development initiatives and limits career progression
- **Staff Experience:** Central to our ability to attract and retain skilled colleagues
- **Organisation Design:** Wellbeing must be integrated into all structural and process design [33]

**Current Gaps:** Our strategy recognises wellbeing importance, but would be strengthened by more comprehensive mental health support, proactive burnout prevention, and integration of wellbeing across all themes [34].

#### Skills Development and Future Workforce

The labour market is demanding new skills – particularly digital health competencies, advanced practice models, and partnership working capabilities. We must invest now in workforce development to meet future demands [35].

**Why This Matters Across All Themes:**

- **People Services:** Skills development improves service delivery capability and staff confidence
- **Inclusion:** Targeted training programmes can enhance diversity and address representation gaps
- **Talent:** Continuous professional development is essential for retention and career progression
- **Staff Experience:** Investment in learning enhances job satisfaction and engagement
- **Organisation Design:** Team-based working and flexible deployment require enhanced skills [36]

**Current Gaps:** Whilst apprenticeships and preceptorships are included, we would benefit from more comprehensive skills forecasting, sustainability skills integration, and interdisciplinary training emphasis [37].

#### System Integration and Partnership

Neighbourhood health models and integrated care systems require genuinely collaborative working across organisations, sectors, and professional boundaries. Successful implementation depends on workforce capability and commitment [38].

**Why This Matters Across All Themes:**

- **People Services:** Partnership working requires enhanced collaborative skills and cross-system understanding
- **Inclusion:** Integration can improve equity by ensuring diverse communities have equal access to services
- **Talent:** Shared learning and development programmes enhance talent development
- **Staff Experience:** Collaborative models improve staff experience through reduced isolation and shared resources
- **Organisation Design:** System integration is fundamental to delivering neighbourhood health models effectively [39]

**Current Gaps:** Whilst system partnership is mentioned in Organisation Design, our objectives would be strengthened by explicit integration goals across all themes, shared governance frameworks, and collaborative workforce planning [40].
