   *Counter-example:* "This strategy focuses on organizational efficiency and operational improvements to meet corporate targets."

2. **Collaborative and inclusive**: Emphasize partnership, teamwork, and shared responsibility [NON-NEGOTIABLE - ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY]

## Preserving References During Styling

When applying this style guide to reformat an analysis document (gap analysis, evidence synthesis, research review, etc.):

### Citation Preservation Rule [NON-NEGOTIABLE]

All inline citations from the original analysis document MUST be preserved during reformatting. Do NOT remove, consolidate, or lose any citations.

### Two Acceptable Approaches

**Option A: Keep Inline Citations (Simplest)**
- Preserve all [Source: filename] citations inline within the text as they appear
- No conversion needed
- Example: "This is supported by evidence [Source: NHS england Productivity.md]"

**Option B: Convert to Numbered References (If document format requires it)**
- Extract ALL citations from original BEFORE reformatting begins
- Convert EVERY [Source: filename] to numbered brackets [1], [2], etc.
- Create comprehensive reference list at document end matching every number
- MUST be exhaustive - every citation number referenced must have corresponding entry
- Example: "This is supported by evidence [1]" → Reference list includes [1]

### Citation Validation - Before Publishing

- [ ] Count total citations in original document
- [ ] Count total citations in reformatted document
- [ ] Citation counts match exactly
- [ ] No orphaned citations (e.g., reference to [1] with no [1] in reference list)
- [ ] If using numbered format, reference list is complete and sequential
