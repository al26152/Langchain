PURPOSE:
  Classifies all evidence from iteration results into FACT/INFERENCE/ASSUMPTION categories
  with explicit confidence levels, creates Assumptions Register section, and documents
  data gaps and methodology.

FEATURES:
  - Categorizes evidence by type (FACT: direct/verified, INFERENCE: logical conclusion, ASSUMPTION: extrapolation)
  - Assigns confidence levels (85-90%, 70-80%, 50-60%)
  - Identifies data gaps and handling approaches
  - Documents methodology transparency
  - Generates epistemic clarity framework

USAGE:
  from assumptions_register_agent import AssumptionsRegisterAgent

  agent = AssumptionsRegisterAgent()
  register = agent.analyze(evidence_result, organizational_context)
