## Strategic Findings

**Traceability Legend**:
- **[FACT]** = Direct quote/data from source document
- **[SYNTHESIZED]** = Multiple facts combined into coherent insight
- **[INFERENCE]** = Strategic interpretation/implication

### Finding 1: Increasing Referral Volumes and the Need for Strategic Triage

[SYNTHESIZED] The Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust has experienced a statistically significant increase in referral volumes over the past eight months, with contacts completed by teams also showing signs of increase [Source8, Source15].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "A statistically significant pattern of high levels of referrals has now emerged, with 8 consecutive months of higher-than-average volumes."
  → LCH-Trust-Board-Meeting-Public-Papers-4-09-2025-AMENDED _1_
- [FACT] "We are not in full control of the referrals we receive (which is impacted by many factors) however by Q3 we expect to see an increase in the number of rejected referrals due to not meeting criteria."
  → LCH-Trust-Board-Meeting-Public-Papers-4-09-2025-AMENDED _1_

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] The increase in referrals necessitates a more robust triage system to ensure that only appropriate cases are accepted, which will optimize resource allocation and maintain service quality.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Increasing referral volumes and upcoming increase in rejected referrals.
- ASSUMPTION: The current triage system can be optimized to handle increased volumes effectively.
- LOGIC: By enhancing triage processes, LCH can manage demand more effectively and reduce unnecessary strain on resources.

Caution: The inference assumes that the triage system can be improved without additional resources, which may not be the case.

### Finding 2: Emphasis on Equity in Healthcare Access and Outcomes

[SYNTHESIZED] Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust is developing equity data sets focusing on access and outcomes, analyzed by deprivation and ethnicity, and is part of the Leeds Place-based Integrated Care Board monitoring Core20PLUS5 to reduce healthcare inequalities [Source2, Source3].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "We continue to develop a suite of Equity data sets for the Trust on Access (referrals/appointment outcomes and waiting lists) and Outcomes (incidents/outcome measures and mortality) analysed by deprivation and ethnicity."
  → Leeds Community Annual Report 2324
- [FACT] "Data reporting with an equity lens on ethnicities in referrals, waiting times, missed appointments and patient safety incidents."
  → Leeds Community Annual-report-2024-2025

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] The focus on equity requires workforce planning to consider diversity in hiring and training to effectively address the unique needs of diverse populations.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Development of equity data sets and focus on reducing inequalities.
- ASSUMPTION: A diverse workforce is better equipped to address equity challenges.
- LOGIC: By aligning workforce diversity with patient demographics, LCH can improve service delivery and patient outcomes.

Caution: The success of this strategy depends on the availability of diverse candidates and effective training programs.

### Finding 3: Challenges in Data Quality and Performance Reporting

[SYNTHESIZED] Regular reviews and validations of data quality and performance reporting are conducted, but there are ongoing challenges in ensuring accuracy, particularly in waiting list information [Source4, Source5].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "Data quality and the accuracy of performance reporting, including waiting list information, is reviewed regularly."
  → Leeds Community Annual Report 2324
- [FACT] "Validations on waiting list data are collected directly from services on a regular basis."
  → Leeds Community Annual-report-2024-2025

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] Improving data quality and accuracy is crucial for effective workforce planning and resource allocation, as inaccurate data can lead to misinformed decisions.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Ongoing reviews and validations of data quality.
- ASSUMPTION: Improved data accuracy will lead to better decision-making.
- LOGIC: Reliable data is foundational for strategic planning and operational efficiency.

Caution: The inference assumes that data quality improvements are feasible within current resource constraints.

### Finding 4: System Flow Monitoring to Support Resource Allocation

[SYNTHESIZED] LCH is closely monitoring key data indicators to track demand, capacity, and discharge activity, which is crucial for timely interventions and effective resource allocation [Source16].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "LCH will closely monitor key data indicators to track demand, capacity, and discharge activity across services."
  → LCH-Trust-Board-Meeting-Public-Papers-4-09-2025-AMENDED _1_

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] Proactive monitoring of system flow metrics enables LCH to allocate resources dynamically, ensuring that patient care is not compromised during periods of high demand.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Monitoring of key data indicators for demand and capacity.
- ASSUMPTION: Current monitoring systems can provide timely and actionable insights.
- LOGIC: By understanding system flow, LCH can adjust resources to meet patient needs effectively.

Caution: The effectiveness of this strategy depends on the accuracy and timeliness of the data collected.

### Finding 5: Impact of Contractual Penalties on Revenue

[SYNTHESIZED] LCH reflects penalties based on contractual performance in its transaction price, reducing revenue when penalties are incurred [Source12, Source13].

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT] "Where Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust is aware of a penalty based on contractual performance, the Trust reflects this in the transaction price for its recognition of revenue."
  → Leeds Community Annual Report 2324

Strategic Implication:
[INFERENCE] Workforce planning should consider the impact of contractual penalties on revenue, as financial constraints may limit staffing and resource availability.

Basis for inference:
- FACT: Penalties affect revenue recognition.
- ASSUMPTION: Financial constraints directly impact workforce capabilities.
- LOGIC: Understanding financial impacts can guide strategic workforce adjustments to minimize penalties.

Caution: The inference assumes penalties are a significant factor in financial planning, which may not always be the case.
