## Executive Summary

The NHS 10-year plan outlines several key workforce priorities aimed at addressing current and future healthcare needs through strategic workforce development and deployment. 

1. **Workforce Deployment and Retention**: The NHS is focusing on deploying, retaining, and training its workforce effectively. This includes developing a new 10-year Workforce Plan to outline approaches for staff safety management and retention strategies [Source: medium-term-planning-framework-delivering-change-together-2026-27-to-2028-29.md].

2. **Advanced Practice Models**: There is a priority to develop advanced practice models for nurses and other healthcare professionals. This reflects a shift towards a workforce that can adapt to evolving healthcare needs and support the NHS's broader strategic goals [Source: 10-year-health-plan-for-england-executive-summary.md].

3. **Geographic and Health Inequality Considerations**: Workforce deployment will focus on addressing geographic variations and health inequalities. This involves neighborhood-based deployment and targeting workforce development to areas with significant health disparities [Source: Leeds_Demographics_Health_Inequalities_Context_2024.md; Assessment of priority skills to 2030 GOV UK.md].

4. **Skills Development**: There is an emphasis on developing skills in prevention and early intervention, digital health competencies, and partnership working across all staff groups. These skills are essential for modernizing care delivery and improving patient outcomes [Source: Leeds_Demographics_Health_Inequalities_Context_2024.md].

5. **Flexibility and Innovation**: The NHS is encouraged to implement flexible service delivery models and to capitalize on partnership opportunities for efficient resource utilization. This includes innovation in workforce practices to meet the diverse needs of the population [Source: Leeds_Demographics_Health_Inequalities_Context_2024.md].

6. **Local System Control**: The NHS has reduced national priorities to give local systems more control over funding deployment. This strategic move is intended to allow systems to tailor workforce strategies to the specific needs of their local populations [Source: priorities-and-operational-planning-guidance-january-2025.md].

Overall, these priorities reflect a comprehensive approach to workforce planning that integrates safety, skill development, geographic considerations, and local flexibility to ensure the NHS can meet its future healthcare delivery goals. The consensus across sources highlights a focus on adaptability, skill enhancement, and addressing inequalities as central to the NHS's strategic workforce planning.
