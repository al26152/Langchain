# Baseline Analysis System - Implementation Progress

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** New Agents Complete, Integration Phase Beginning

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive analysis of baseline standard document (Enhanced_01_baseline_analysis_output_Leeds_Community_Healthcare_2025-09-21.docx) and created detailed specification. Implemented two critical new agents (AssumptionsRegisterAgent and DataQualityAgent) to support epistemically transparent baseline analysis.

**Key Achievement:** Identified that baseline output requires 67,500-73,500 characters (~13,500-14,500 words) across 8 major sections with explicit confidence frameworks and data quality assessment - significantly richer than current system output.

---

## Phase 1: COMPLETED - Baseline Standard Analysis

### What We Analyzed
- Extracted 73,295 characters from baseline document

   - Reasonable Inferences (Medium Confidence: 70-80%)
   - Strategic Assumptions (Lower Confidence: 50-60%)
   - Data Gaps Requiring Assumption
   - Methodology Transparency

2. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - 1,000 words (not 600 - much longer!)

3. **SECTION 1: Current Workforce Profile** - 2,000 words
   - 1.1 Workforce Composition
   - 1.2 Employment Patterns
   - 1.3 Performance Indicators

4. **SECTION 2: Strategic Context Assessment** - 1,500 words
   - 2.1 Organisational Positioning
   - 2.2 Service Portfolio Analysis

5. **SECTION 3: Baseline SWOT Analysis** - 2,000 words
   - 5-6 items per category with evidence

6. **SECTION 4: Priority Areas for Development** - 3,000 words
   - Each priority includes: rationale, performance baseline, focus areas, success indicators, resource requirements, ROI

7. **SECTION 5: Data Quality Assessment** - 1,500 words
   - 5.1 Current Data Completeness
   - 5.2 Data Gaps Requiring Attention
   - 5.3 Data Collection Enhancement Strategy
   - 5.4 Confidence Framework

8. **APPENDICES** (References to dashboards and risk registers)

**Critical Differentiators:**
- Assumptions Register FIRST (not buried)
- Explicit confidence levels assigned to evidence
- Resource requirements with specific costs and ROI
- Data quality section with transparency about limitations
- Balanced SWOT analysis with evidence base
- Longitudinal planning framework (Years 1-2 vs 3-5)

## Phase 2: COMPLETED - New Agent Implementation

### 1. AssumptionsRegisterAgent ✓
**File:** `analysis/multi_agent/assumptions_register_agent.py` (281 lines)

**Capabilities:**
- Classifies evidence chunks into FACT/INFERENCE/ASSUMPTION
- Assigns confidence levels (85-90%, 70-80%, 50-60%)
- Identifies data gaps and handling approaches
- Documents methodology and alternative approaches
- Generates epistemic clarity framework

**Key Methods:**
```python
analyze(evidence_chunks, iteration_results, query, web_context)
  → Returns: facts, inferences, assumptions, gaps, methodology, summary

_classify_single_chunk(content, source)
  → Returns: type, confidence, reasoning

_identify_data_gaps(chunks, query, facts, inferences, assumptions)
  → Returns: list of identified gaps with severity

generate_register_markdown(register)
  → Returns: Markdown-formatted Assumptions Register section
```

**Quality:**
- Production-ready code with comprehensive docstrings
- Handles edge cases (empty results, missing data)
- Provides markdown generation for direct inclusion in reports

---

### 2. DataQualityAgent ✓
**File:** `analysis/multi_agent/data_quality_agent.py` (370 lines)

**Capabilities:**
- Classifies sources by quality: High (85-90%), Medium (70-80%), Lower (50-60%)
- Identifies critical gaps, medium gaps, low gaps
- Ranks data collection priorities
- Creates enhancement strategy with timeline

**Key Methods:**
```python
assess(evidence_chunks, iteration_results, query, web_context)
  → Returns: high/medium/lower quality sources, gaps, priorities, strategy

_classify_sources(chunks)
  → Returns: quality classification with confidence scores

_identify_gaps(chunks, query, high, medium, lower)
  → Returns: critical/medium/low gaps with handling approaches

_rank_collection_priorities(critical_gaps, medium_gaps, chunks)
  → Returns: prioritized list with timeline and impact

_create_enhancement_strategy(...)
  → Returns: 3-phase data collection strategy

generate_assessment_markdown(assessment)
  → Returns: Markdown-formatted Data Quality Assessment section
```

**Quality:**
- Sophisticated source quality scoring algorithm
- Identifies workforce-specific, strategic, and quantitative gaps
- Provides actionable enhancement timeline (Phase 1-3)
- Ready for integration
