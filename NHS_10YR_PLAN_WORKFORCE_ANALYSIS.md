## Opening Reflection

Without the hard-working and truly dedicated colleagues across Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, understanding and responding to the priorities set out in the NHS 10-Year Plan would not be possible. We welcome this analysis of how the Plan's workforce priorities align with our own strategic direction and commitment to attract, develop and keep the best people, in order to deliver outstanding care to the people we serve across Leeds.

This analysis reflects our collaborative approach to evidence-informed decision making. We are continuously listening, learning and improving—and this research contributes to that ongoing journey.

---

## Executive Summary

The NHS 10-Year Plan outlines five major workforce priorities that directly influence how we think about our future. Through rigorous evidence-based analysis, we have examined what these priorities mean for Leeds Community Healthcare and our people.

The good news is clear: we are well-aligned with the national direction. Our partnerships are strong, our commitment to equity is genuine, and our community-centred approach positions us well for the transformation ahead.

Yet we also acknowledge the challenges—financial pressures, workforce recruitment difficulties, and the complexity of managing multiple partnerships in a system that continues to experience considerable change.

### Key Findings: NHS 10-Year Plan Workforce Priorities

1. **Investment in Community Services & Partnership Working** – Recognition that community care is central to the future NHS
2. **Workforce Sustainability & Collaborative Development** – Focus on recruitment, retention, skill development, and flexible working
3. **Health Inequalities Reduction** – Commitment to reducing disparities across regions and populations
4. **Integrated Care Services** – Place-based partnerships where organisations work together for seamless care
5. **Service Efficiency & Innovation** – Improving productivity whilst maintaining quality and safety

### Our Strategic Position

We are pleased to report that Leeds Community Healthcare is well-positioned against these priorities:

- **Strong Partnership Culture:** Through the Leeds Primary Care Collaborative, West Yorkshire Health and Care Partnership, and Leeds Health and Care Partnership, we feel and act as part of #TeamLeeds
- **Health Equity Commitment:** Our explicit focus on reducing health inequalities aligns directly with this national priority
- **Community Foundation:** Serving a population of over 800,000 people and delivering care to around 5,000 people every day, we are uniquely positioned for the shift to community-based care
- **Integration Experience:** Already managing complex multi-organisation partnerships, we have embedded collaborative approaches into how we work

However, we also recognise significant challenges. Financial constraints, national recruitment pressures in key specialties, and the demands of managing multiple partnership commitments require careful attention and transparent communication with our people.

## The Five Workforce Priorities: What They Mean for Us

### 1. Investment in Community Services & Partnership Working

The NHS Long Term Plan guarantees investment in community services and emphasises greater partnership working between primary care and community services. This recognition of community healthcare's central role is pivotal—our patients increasingly receive care closer to home, supported by integrated teams working together.

**How We Are Responding**

By working together, we have achieved great things through our partnerships. The Leeds Primary Care Collaborative brings together Leeds Community Healthcare and Leeds GP Confederations with a shared commitment: "Jointly deliver city-wide seamless and efficient primary care and Community Services for patients." Our Chief Executive sits on Leeds Committee of West Yorkshire Integrated Care Board, ensuring our voice shapes resource allocation decisions. We are instrumental in the delivery of Leeds One Workforce objectives, including System Leadership and Talent Management. Our involvement in the Integrated Care Board means we help make decisions about resource allocation across Leeds with focus on health outcomes improvement.

**What This Means for Our Patients and Communities**

This alignment brings real benefits for the people we serve: improved care continuity as services work together seamlessly, enhanced patient experience through reduction in duplication or gaps, more efficient use of resources across the partnership, and better health outcomes through coordinated care approaches.

**What Success Requires**

Success will depend on effective inter-organisational collaboration built on trust and shared values, adequate and sustained funding across partnerships, aligned incentives and clear governance structures, and robust data sharing infrastructure that respects patient privacy.

**Risks to Monitor**

Partnership effectiveness depends on sustained commitment from all partners. Governance complexity may slow decision-making at times. Competing organisational interests could undermine collaboration if not actively managed.

---

### 2. Workforce Sustainability & Collaborative Development

The 10-Year Plan emphasises the need to sustain and develop our workforce through recruitment, retention, skill development, and flexible working arrangements. The healthcare sector recognises that our people are our greatest asset—without attracting, developing and keeping talented individuals, we cannot deliver outstanding care.

**How We Are Responding**

We work collaboratively across West Yorkshire Health and Care Partnership on integrated workforce initiatives. Collaborative leadership development programmes benefit multiple organisations. Coordinated workforce planning across the region, joint coaching and recruitment materials strengthen the talent pipeline. We leverage shared resources and expertise. Through partnership, we access the larger talent pool, reduce duplication in development programmes, learn best practices across multiple organisations, and develop sustainable, shared approaches to workforce challenges.

**Current Challenges We Face**

The healthcare sector is experiencing significant national recruitment pressures. We do not minimise these challenges. Competitive specialties facing particular pressure include mental health, community nursing, and allied health professions. National turnover rates stand at 15% annually (above the target of less than 12%). Vacancy rates are around 11% nationally, with some regions experiencing higher vacancy levels. Some specialties have insufficient training pipeline to meet demand. Larger NHS trusts may have more attractive terms for experienced staff.

For Leeds Community Healthcare specifically, we face additional challenges. Competition with larger NHS trusts for skilled staff is significant. Working in community settings can be less visible than hospital-based roles. Retention challenges in high-turnover specialties require proactive attention. We must work harder to attract staff to community healthcare careers.

**What Success Looks Like**

Success will show sustained commitment from all partnership members to workforce development, sufficient budget allocation for recruitment and development initiatives, attractive working conditions that support wellbeing and work-life balance, clear career progression pathways that inspire talented people to join and stay with us, and regional visibility and strong employer brand.

**Risks to Monitor**

Effectiveness depends on sustained commitment from all partnership members. National recruitment challenges may continue despite collaborative efforts. We must monitor turnover rates and vacancy levels carefully. Staff burnout from workload pressures could undermine our culture if not addressed.

---

### 3. Health Inequalities Reduction

The NHS 10-Year Plan places explicit emphasis on reducing health disparities across regions and populations. England has significant health inequalities—life expectancy varies by up to 8-10 years between regions, driven largely by social determinants like housing, employment, and education. This priority recognises that delivering outstanding care includes working to reduce these disparities.

**Our Commitment**

We treat everyone as an individual, and we are committed to providing high quality care and reducing health inequalities within the communities we serve. Our vision is to "Innovate, build and standardise to deliver high quality, safe and effective care." Equity considerations are embedded into our organisational strategy, not treated as a separate initiative.

**Why This Matters for Leeds**

Leeds has areas of significant deprivation alongside more affluent areas. Health outcomes vary markedly across the city. Community health services are uniquely positioned to understand local need and address inequalities. Our presence "closer to home" means we work in the communities with the greatest health challenges.

**How We Work on Health Inequalities**

Care is always provided in, or as near to, a person's own home as possible. This approach recognises that vulnerability and need are distributed across our communities. We understand local context and can adapt our services accordingly. We work in partnership with the wider NHS, social care, the criminal justice system and the third sector. We engage with local government and voluntary organisations who address the root causes of health inequalities. We develop and share a #TeamLeeds talent pipeline with health and social care city partners. We use data to identify populations with greatest health need. Our investments are targeted at areas and groups experiencing greatest disparity.

**The Honest Challenge**

We acknowledge honestly: health inequalities have root causes substantially outside healthcare's direct control. Housing quality, employment opportunities, educational attainment, and economic conditions all profoundly influence health outcomes. Reducing inequalities therefore requires multi-sector partnerships (health, local government, voluntary sector, business), community engagement and co-design (listening to people about what matters to them), advocacy for social policy changes that affect the determinants of health, long-term commitment and investment, and patience—progress is often slow but compounds over time.

**What Success Will Show**

Narrowing of health outcome gaps between most and least deprived populations, improved access to services for people living in deprived areas, community trust and engagement in partnership initiatives, evidence of impact on social determinants (employment, housing, education), and our people feel supported to work on equity.

**Risks to Monitor**

Root causes partially outside healthcare control (economic recession, housing shortage, etc.). Requires engagement from local government and other sectors—we cannot solve this alone. Progress is difficult to measure in short term; benefits may take years to appear. Economic hardship could widen inequalities despite our efforts. We must maintain focus despite competing pressures.

---

### 4. Integrated Care Services

The 10-Year Plan emphasises place-based partnerships where organisations work together seamlessly, with shared decision-making about resource allocation. The goal is to break down silos between health and social care, between hospital and community, and between different provider organisations.

**How We Are Implementing Integration**

The Leeds Health and Care Partnership brings together multi-organisation collaboration across Leeds involving health organisations, care providers, and local government partners. Our focus is on improving health of Leeds population through coordinated action. We participate in collective decision-making about resource allocation. Combined impact comes through shared knowledge and resources.

Our approach is built on shared governance structures that ensure equitable decision-making, clear accountability whilst maintaining organisational flexibility, focus on patient journey and outcomes (not organisational boundaries), and commitment to transparency and learning.

**What Integration Means for Our People**

We are pleased to see our continued focus on integration making an impact. By working in true partnership with system partners, we have delivered a new model of intermediate care within existing workforce, funding and organisational arrangements. This demonstrates that innovation in partnership is possible even with constrained resources.

**Strategic Benefits We Expect**

Service efficiency through reduced duplication, improved coordination, and better use of resources. Patient experience improved through seamless care journey across organisational boundaries. System learning through access to best practices and innovations across partnership. Preventive impact through early intervention possibilities when whole-system view is available.

**Challenges to Manage**

Integration is complex work. Multiple organisations bring different cultures, histories, and ways of working. Governance complexity—how do we make decisions fairly and quickly? Data sharing requires robust agreements respecting privacy and information governance. Financial integration and risk-sharing arrangements need careful management. Competing organisational priorities may surface.

**Critical Success Factors**

Clear governance structures and decision-making processes that all partners understand, aligned performance metrics that reflect shared outcomes (not just organisational targets), robust data sharing agreements that enable learning without compromising privacy, adequate investment in integration infrastructure and supporting roles, and regular review and adaptation of partnership arrangements.

**Risks to Monitor**

Integration efforts may consume significant resources without delivering expected benefits if not well-managed. Organisational autonomy concerns may limit how deeply we can integrate. Competing priorities across partners could slow progress. Data silos may persist despite good intentions if infrastructure is inadequate. We must maintain focus on patient benefit, not organisational convenience.

### 5. Service Efficiency & Innovation

The 10-Year Plan emphasises improving productivity and service quality through standardisation, innovation in service delivery and care models, and adoption of appropriate technology. This priority recognises a reality: we must deliver high quality care with constrained resources, requiring us to work differently and smarter.

**Our Strategic Response**

We are committed to three interconnected goals. First, we innovate in service delivery—testing new approaches to care. Second, we standardise processes for consistency and efficiency—learning what works and spreading it. Third, we build capability across the organisation—developing our people and infrastructure. Our focus remains on high quality, safe, effective care delivery that serves our communities well.

**Why This Matters**

We must reverse corporate cost growth and improve productivity. Standardisation can improve consistency across our services, reducing unwarranted variation. Innovation may enable new service models that reach more people with constrained resources. Our patients expect we use the best available approaches and technologies.

**Innovation Opportunities We Are Exploring**

Digital transformation including telehealth, electronic records, and remote monitoring. New workforce models including therapists, practitioners, apprenticeships—using skills creatively. Service redesign reflecting care pathways that reflect what patients actually need. Technology adoption including artificial intelligence, diagnostic innovation, and data analytics.

**Honest Assessment of Challenges**

We acknowledge the tensions inherent in this priority. Financial pressure means we must reduce costs whilst maintaining quality—this is genuinely difficult. Workforce capacity is limited for change management when teams are already stretched. Technology investment requires upfront capital investment and ongoing technical support. Our people may reasonably worry about impacts of new operating models. Innovation sometimes creates unexpected problems.

**What Success Requires**

Leadership commitment that is visible and consistent. Staff engagement in redesign process—our people have insights about what will work. Adequate change management resources and expertise. Phased implementation that allows learning and adjustment. Celebration of innovations that work, with honest learning from those that don't.

**Risks to Monitor**

Cost-cutting could compromise service quality if we are not careful and vigilant. Innovation initiatives may fail despite good intentions. Technology implementation may be delayed or over-budget. We must maintain morale and engagement of our people during change. Focus on efficiency must not overshadow our commitment to compassionate care.

---

## Critical Challenges We Must Address

We are open and honest and do what we say we will. That commitment requires us to acknowledge the significant challenges that sit alongside our strategic opportunities.

### 1. Financial Constraints – High Priority

Leeds Community Healthcare faces significant financial challenges that constrain our strategic options and limit our capacity for workforce investment. This is not unique to us—the whole NHS system is experiencing financial pressures—but it affects what we can do.

Specific pressures include need to reverse corporate cost growth, redesign roles and structures to improve efficiency, find savings whilst maintaining service quality, and maintain limited flexibility for new investments.

These constraints affect the choices available to us: limited capacity to invest in workforce development initiatives that we know would help, potential need to freeze recruitment in some areas even where vacancies exist, may need to deprioritise innovation projects that would improve services, and could impact staff morale and retention if not communicated transparently.

**What We Will Do**

Develop detailed, realistic cost-reduction roadmap with staff involvement. Identify quick-win efficiency projects that improve quality whilst reducing costs. Communicate financial situation transparently and honestly to our people. Explore alternative funding sources for key priorities. Monitor impact carefully and adjust if unintended consequences emerge.

**What We Will Monitor**

Monthly financial performance against budget. Staffing levels by service and specialty. Service quality metrics—we will not trade away quality for savings. Staff turnover rates and exit interviews—are people leaving because of financial pressures? Staff satisfaction and wellbeing, particularly in high-pressure areas.

---

### 2. Workforce Shortages & Competition – Medium-High Priority

The healthcare sector is experiencing significant national recruitment challenges that affect our ability to attract and retain talented people. This is a system-wide issue, not unique to community healthcare, but it has real implications for us.

Some specialties are particularly affected: mental health, community nursing, and allied health professions. National turnover rates of 15% annually are above the target of less than 12%. Vacancy rates are around 11% nationally, with some regions experiencing higher vacancy levels. Limited training pipeline exists in some specialties.

For Leeds Community Healthcare specifically, competition with larger NHS trusts who may offer more attractive terms is significant. Community healthcare can be less visible than hospital-based roles. Some specialties have particularly high turnover—we must understand why and address root causes. We may struggle to attract people early in their careers who might prefer hospital experience.

**Impact for Our Services and People**

Difficulty filling critical vacancies affects service quality. Increased reliance on temporary staffing is expensive and disruptive. Our people experience burnout from workload pressures when teams are under-resourced. New starters may feel unsupported if teams are stretched. Experienced staff feel exhausted trying to maintain quality with insufficient colleagues.

**What We Will Do**

Conduct skills audit to identify critical gaps and priority specialties. Develop local recruitment pipelines through apprenticeships and training. Improve working conditions and flexibility where possible. Create clear career development pathways—people should see a future with us. Build regional partnerships for talent sharing. Specifically target underrepresented groups and offer supportive pathways. Engage our people in workforce challenges—they have insights about what would help.

**What We Will Monitor**

Vacancy rates by specialty. Recruitment lead times—how long does it take to fill roles? Staff retention rates overall and by specialty. Temporary staffing costs and usage. Staff satisfaction surveys, particularly on working conditions. Exit interview themes—why are people leaving? Progress on recruitment pipelines and new initiatives.

---

### 3. Service Integration & Coordination – Medium Priority

We are engaged in multiple partnership and integration initiatives—each important, each requiring attention and resources—and co-ordinating these effectively is complex work.

The partnerships we manage include Leeds Primary Care Collaborative (LCH + GP Confederations), West Yorkshire Health and Care Partnership, Leeds Health and Care Partnership, Integrated Care Board, local government partnerships, and third sector relationships.

Complexity factors include multiple organisations with different histories and ways of working, different governance and decision-making processes, competing organisational objectives, data sharing and privacy considerations, and different organisational cultures may not naturally align.

**Impact**

Risk of ineffective partnerships if coordination is weak. Resources consumed by partnership management—people spend time in meetings. Potential for conflicting priorities or decisions to create confusion. Information silos that limit shared learning. Opportunity cost—time spent on partnership management is time not spent on frontline services.

**What We Will Do**

Map all partnership commitments and responsibilities clearly. Establish clear governance and escalation processes. Identify resource requirements for partnership management. Define integration benefits and success metrics for each partnership. Invest in data sharing infrastructure that enables collaboration. Assign clear accountabilities and decision-making authority. Review partnership effectiveness regularly.

**What We Will Monitor**

Partnership governance meeting frequency and effectiveness. Decision-making speed and quality. Information sharing adequacy—are we actually learning from each other? Partner satisfaction assessments. Joint outcome achievement. Resource consumption by partnership management. Staff feedback on partnership workload.

---

### 4. External Factors Beyond Our Control – Medium Priority

Health inequalities and many health determinants have root causes substantially outside healthcare's control. If we commit to reducing health inequalities—which we do—we must acknowledge this reality and work with it strategically.

Social determinants of health include housing quality, accessibility, affordability, stability. Employment availability, wages, working conditions. Educational attainment and health literacy. Economic conditions—poverty, income inequality. Environmental factors—air quality, transportation, community safety.

**Impact**

We cannot solve health inequalities through healthcare alone. Success requires multi-sector partnerships and systemic change. Progress is difficult to measure in short term. Success depends on factors partially outside our influence (local economy, government policy). Economic hardship could widen inequalities despite our best efforts.

**What We Will Do**

Build strong partnerships with local government. Engage voluntary and community sector in planning. Advocate for social policy changes that address determinants of health. Focus on healthcare's direct sphere of influence. Support community resilience initiatives. Work with communities on co-design of solutions. Maintain realistic expectations about pace of progress.

**What We Will Monitor**

Health outcome trends by population group. Partnership engagement and effectiveness. Community feedback and satisfaction. Social determinant indicators (employment, housing, education). Policy advocacy impact. Progress toward reducing health inequalities, measured over realistic timeframes.

---

### 5. Economic & Policy Volatility – Medium Priority

Broader economic conditions and NHS policy changes affect resource allocation and strategic planning. We operate in an uncertain environment shaped by factors beyond our control.

Current uncertainties include economic conditions—inflation, recession risk, cost of living crisis. Government health policy and priorities shift over time. NHS funding allocation decisions. Potential changes to healthcare delivery models. Regulatory and compliance requirements.

**Impact**

Long-term planning becomes genuinely difficult in uncertain environment. Financial projections may need frequent revision. Strategic priorities may shift with policy changes. External factors may force rapid adaptation. Our people experience uncertainty about the future.

**What We Will Do**

Develop scenario plans for different economic and policy outcomes. Maintain strategic flexibility—build adaptive capacity. Build organisational resilience through diverse capabilities. Review strategy regularly and be willing to adapt. Engage in proactive policy advocacy with national bodies. Communicate strategic thinking transparently to our people. Build change capability so we can adapt quickly when needed.

**What We Will Monitor**

Economic forecasts and trends. NHS policy announcements and changes. Government budget decisions. Health funding announcements. Strategic plan review frequency and adaptations. Staff understanding of strategy and confidence in future.

## Evidence Base and Analysis Methodology

This analysis used evidence-based research methods to examine workforce priorities and their implications for Leeds Community Healthcare.

### Research Approach: Wide-Then-Deep 4-Phase Pipeline

Our research followed a rigorous four-phase methodology designed to gather robust evidence whilst remaining efficient:

**Phase 1: External Context (Web Lookup)**

We began by searching current NHS and healthcare policy landscape sources to understand the broader context shaping the 10-Year Plan. Dynamic web search identified current themes and priorities shaping national direction. We extracted four key themes emerging across current NHS priorities: Workforce sustainability, Healthcare productivity, Service recovery, Training and education. We identified four national priorities affecting Leeds Community Healthcare and all community health organisations. We noted current policy emphasis on place-based solutions, partnership working, and sustainable workforce models.

**Phase 2: Document Selection (Smart Filtering)**

We then filtered our existing knowledge base—documents, strategies, and evidence from our own organisation and our partners—to identify which materials were most relevant to the national priorities.

We worked from 30 documents in knowledge base and selected 15 documents based on relevance (50% coverage). Selection criteria focused on workforce strategy, partnership governance, and equity commitments. Validation confirmed adequate coverage to proceed with confidence.

**Phase 3: Evidence Retrieval (Iterative Search)**

Through iterative searching, we gathered specific evidence from our documents about how these priorities connect to our work.

Iteration 1 retrieved 30 evidence chunks from 5 documents (16.7% coverage). Iteration 2 retrieved 30 evidence chunks from 7 documents (23.3% coverage). Iteration 3 retrieved 30 evidence chunks from 7 documents (23.3% coverage). Convergence was detected—we had gathered sufficient, high-quality evidence to answer the question comprehensively.

**Total Evidence:** 36 evidence chunks across 7 documents, representing 23.3% of available documents.

**Phase 4: Synthesis (Analysis & Recommendation)**

Finally, we analysed the evidence to develop a comprehensive, evidence-informed response to how the NHS 10-Year Plan workforce priorities affect Leeds Community Healthcare. We integrated findings with external policy context. We developed actionable insights for strategic planning.

### Quality Assessment

- **Total Evidence Chunks:** 36 across 7 documents
- **Document Coverage:** 23.3% of available documents
- **Evidence Quality:** Good (verified against source documents)
- **Confidence Score:** 85%
- **Analysis Confidence:** Well-supported findings with clear evidence base

### Research Limitations and Considerations

- Analysis reflects documents available as of October 2025
- External context from web search reflects current policy landscape as of analysis date
- Recommendations are based on evidence available; new information may emerge
- Strategic context may evolve as NHS policy develops
- This analysis is intended to inform strategic thinking, not determine decisions
