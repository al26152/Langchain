## Opening Reflection

Without the hard-working and truly dedicated colleagues across Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, understanding and responding to the priorities set out in the NHS 10-Year Plan would not be possible. We welcome this analysis of how the Plan's workforce priorities align with our own strategic direction and commitment to attract, develop and keep the best people, in order to deliver outstanding care to the people we serve across Leeds.

This analysis reflects our collaborative approach to evidence-informed decision making. We are continuously listening, learning and improving—and this research contributes to that ongoing journey.

---

## Executive Summary

The NHS 10-Year Plan outlines five major workforce priorities that directly influence how we think about our future. Through this analysis, we have examined what these priorities mean for Leeds Community Healthcare and our people.

The good news is clear: we are well-aligned with the national direction. Our partnerships are strong, our commitment to equity is genuine, and our community-centred approach positions us well for the transformation ahead.

Yet we also acknowledge the challenges—financial pressures, workforce recruitment difficulties, and the complexity of managing multiple partnerships in a system that continues to experience considerable change.

### Key Findings: NHS 10-Year Plan Workforce Priorities

1. **Investment in Community Services & Partnership Working** – Recognition that community care is central to the future NHS
2. **Workforce Sustainability & Collaborative Development** – Focus on recruitment, retention, skill development, and flexible working
3. **Health Inequalities Reduction** – Commitment to reducing disparities across regions and populations
4. **Integrated Care Services** – Place-based partnerships where organisations work together for seamless care
5. **Service Efficiency & Innovation** – Improving productivity whilst maintaining quality and safety

### Our Strategic Position

We are pleased to report that Leeds Community Healthcare is well-positioned against these priorities:

- **Strong Partnership Culture:** Through the Leeds Primary Care Collaborative, West Yorkshire Health and Care Partnership, and Leeds Health and Care Partnership, we feel and act as part of #TeamLeeds
- **Health Equity Commitment:** Our explicit focus on reducing health inequalities aligns directly with this national priority
- **Community Foundation:** Serving a population of over 800,000 people and delivering care to around 5,000 people every day, we are uniquely positioned for the shift to community-based care
- **Integration Experience:** Already managing complex multi-organisation partnerships, we have embedded collaborative approaches into how we work

However, we also recognise significant challenges. Financial constraints, national recruitment pressures in key specialties, and the demands of managing multiple partnership commitments require careful attention and transparent communication with our people.

## How We Conducted This Analysis

We recognise that understanding the case for, and the impact of, interventions is vital, to ensure efficacy and minimise waste. This analysis used our evidence-based approach to examine workforce priorities and their relevance to our organisation.

### Phase 1: External Context – What Is Happening in the NHS?

Our first step was to search current NHS and healthcare landscape sources, identifying the themes and priorities that are shaping national policy. This gave us up-to-date understanding of the broader context within which the 10-Year Plan sits.

**What We Found:**
- Four key themes emerging across current NHS priorities: Workforce sustainability, Healthcare productivity, Service recovery, Training and education
- Four national priorities affecting Leeds Community Healthcare and all community health organisations
- Current policy emphasis on place-based solutions, partnership working, and sustainable workforce models

### Phase 2: Document Selection – What Do We Know Locally?

We then filtered our existing knowledge base—documents, strategies, and evidence from our own organisation and our partners—to identify which materials were most relevant to the national priorities.

**Selection Results:**
- 15 documents selected from 30 in our knowledge base (50% coverage)
- Focus on workforce strategy, partnership governance, and equity commitments
- Validation: Adequate coverage to proceed with confidence

### Phase 3: Evidence Gathering – What Is Our Evidence?

Through iterative searching, we gathered specific evidence from our documents about how these priorities connect to our work.

**Evidence Collected:**
- Iteration 1: 30 evidence chunks from 5 documents
- Iteration 2: 30 evidence chunks from 7 documents
- Iteration 3: 30 evidence chunks from 7 documents
- **Convergence detected** – we had gathered sufficient, high-quality evidence to answer the question

**Total:** 36 evidence chunks across 7 documents, representing 23.3% of available documents

### Phase 4: Synthesis – What Does This Mean for Us?

Finally, we analysed the evidence to develop a comprehensive, evidence-informed response to how the NHS 10-Year Plan workforce priorities affect Leeds Community Healthcare.

**Overall Assessment:** Good quality evidence with 85% confidence in findings

## The Five Workforce Priorities: What They Mean for Us

### 1. Investment in Community Services & Partnership Working

#### What The Priority Means

The NHS Long Term Plan guarantees investment in community services and emphasises greater partnership working between primary care and community services. This recognition of community healthcare's central role is pivotal—our patients increasingly receive care closer to home, supported by integrated teams working together.

#### How We Are Responding

By working together, we have achieved great things through our partnerships:

**Leeds Primary Care Collaborative**
- Partnership between Leeds Community Healthcare and Leeds GP Confederations
- Shared commitment: "Jointly deliver city-wide seamless and efficient primary care and Community Services for patients"
- Our Chief Executive sits on Leeds Committee of West Yorkshire Integrated Care Board, ensuring our voice shapes resource allocation decisions

**System Leadership**
- We are instrumental in the delivery of Leeds One Workforce objectives, including System Leadership and Talent Management
- Our involvement in the Integrated Care Board means we help make decisions about resource allocation across Leeds with focus on health outcomes improvement

#### What This Means for Our Patients and Communities

This alignment brings real benefits for the people we serve:
- Improved care continuity as services work together seamlessly
- Enhanced patient experience through reduction in duplication or gaps
- More efficient use of resources across the partnership
- Better health outcomes through coordinated care approaches

#### Success Will Depend On

- Effective inter-organisational collaboration built on trust and shared values
- Adequate and sustained funding across partnerships
- Aligned incentives and clear governance structures
- Robust data sharing infrastructure that respects patient privacy

#### Risks to Monitor

- Partnership effectiveness depends on sustained commitment from all partners
- Governance complexity may slow decision-making at times
- Competing organisational interests could undermine collaboration if not actively managed

---

### 2. Workforce Sustainability & Collaborative Development

#### What The Priority Means

The 10-Year Plan emphasises the need to sustain and develop our workforce through recruitment, retention, skill development, and flexible working arrangements. The healthcare sector recognises that our people are our greatest asset—without attracting, developing and keeping talented individuals, we cannot deliver outstanding care.

#### How We Are Responding

We work collaboratively across West Yorkshire Health and Care Partnership on integrated workforce initiatives:

**Shared Workforce Development**
- Collaborative leadership development programmes that benefit multiple organisations
- Coordinated workforce planning across the region
- Joint coaching and recruitment materials that strengthen the talent pipeline
- Leverage shared resources and expertise

**West Yorkshire Approach**
- Access to the larger talent pool through partnership
- Reduced duplication in development programmes
- Opportunity to learn best practices across multiple organisations
- Sustainable, shared approach to workforce challenges

#### Current Challenges We Face

The healthcare sector is experiencing significant national recruitment pressures. We do not minimise these challenges:

- **Competitive specialties facing particular pressure:** Mental health, community nursing, and allied health professions
- **National turnover rates:** 15% annually (above the target of less than 12%)
- **Vacancy rates:** Around 11% nationally, with some regions experiencing higher vacancy levels
- **Limited training capacity:** Some specialties have insufficient training pipeline to meet demand
- **Competition:** Larger NHS trusts may have more attractive terms for experienced staff

For Leeds Community Healthcare specifically, we face additional challenges:
- Competition with larger NHS trusts for skilled staff
- Working in community settings can be less visible than hospital-based roles
- Retention challenges in high-turnover specialties require proactive attention
- We must work harder to attract staff to community healthcare careers

#### What Success Looks Like

- Sustained commitment from all partnership members to workforce development
- Sufficient budget allocation for recruitment and development initiatives
- Attractive working conditions that support wellbeing and work-life balance
- Clear career progression pathways that inspire talented people to join and stay with us
- Regional visibility and strong employer brand

#### Strategic Implications for Our Organisation

- Through partnership, we expand our reach beyond what we could achieve alone
- Access to best practices and innovations from across the partnership
- Opportunity to build a sustainable workforce model that attracts talented people
- Chance to position ourselves as an employer of choice in the community health sector

#### Risks to Monitor

- Effectiveness depends on sustained commitment from all partnership members
- National recruitment challenges may continue despite collaborative efforts
- We must monitor turnover rates and vacancy levels carefully
- Staff burnout from workload pressures could undermine our culture if not addressed

---

### 3. Health Inequalities Reduction

#### What The Priority Means

The NHS 10-Year Plan places explicit emphasis on reducing health disparities across regions and populations. England has significant health inequalities—life expectancy varies by up to 8-10 years between regions, driven largely by social determinants like housing, employment, and education. This priority recognises that delivering outstanding care includes working to reduce these disparities.

#### Our Commitment

We treat everyone as an individual, and we are committed to providing high quality care and reducing health inequalities within the communities we serve.

**Our Vision:** "Innovate, build and standardise to deliver high quality, safe and effective care"

**Our Approach:** Equity considerations are embedded into our organisational strategy, not treated as a separate initiative.

#### Why This Matters for Leeds

- Leeds has areas of significant deprivation alongside more affluent areas
- Health outcomes vary markedly across the city
- Community health services are uniquely positioned to understand local need and address inequalities
- Our presence "closer to home" means we work in the communities with the greatest health challenges

#### How We Work on Health Inequalities

**Community-Based Services**
- Care is always provided in, or as near to, a person's own home as possible
- This approach recognises that vulnerability and need are distributed across our communities
- We understand local context and can adapt our services accordingly

**Multi-Sector Partnerships**
- We work in partnership with the wider NHS, social care, the criminal justice system and the third sector
- We engage with local government and voluntary organisations who address the root causes of health inequalities
- We develop and share a #TeamLeeds talent pipeline with health and social care city partners

**Data-Driven Targeting**
- We use data to identify populations with greatest health need
- Our investments are targeted at areas and groups experiencing greatest disparity

#### The Broader Challenge

We acknowledge honestly: health inequalities have root causes substantially outside healthcare's direct control. Housing quality, employment opportunities, educational attainment, and economic conditions all profoundly influence health outcomes. Reducing inequalities therefore requires:

- Multi-sector partnerships (health, local government, voluntary sector, business)
- Community engagement and co-design (listening to people about what matters to them)
- Advocacy for social policy changes that affect the determinants of health
- Long-term commitment and investment
- Patience—progress is often slow but compounds over time

#### What Success Will Show

- Narrowing of health outcome gaps between most and least deprived populations
- Improved access to services for people living in deprived areas
- Community trust and engagement in partnership initiatives
- Evidence of impact on social determinants (employment, housing, education)
- Our people feel supported to work on equity

#### Risks to Monitor

- Root causes partially outside healthcare control (economic recession, housing shortage, etc.)
- Requires engagement from local government and other sectors—we cannot solve this alone
- Progress is difficult to measure in short term; benefits may take years to appear
- Economic hardship could widen inequalities despite our efforts
- We must maintain focus despite competing pressures

### 4. Integrated Care Services

#### What The Priority Means

The 10-Year Plan emphasises place-based partnerships where organisations work together seamlessly, with shared decision-making about resource allocation. The goal is to break down silos between health and social care, between hospital and community, and between different provider organisations.

#### How We Are Implementing Integration

**Leeds Health and Care Partnership**
- Multi-organisation collaboration across Leeds involving health organisations, care providers, and local government partners
- Focus: Improving health of Leeds population through coordinated action
- We participate in collective decision-making about resource allocation
- Combined impact through shared knowledge and resources

**Key Features of Our Approach**
- Shared governance structures that ensure equitable decision-making
- Clear accountability whilst maintaining organisational flexibility
- Focus on patient journey and outcomes, not organisational boundaries
- Commitment to transparency and learning

#### What Integration Means for Our People

We are pleased to see our continued focus on integration making an impact. By working in true partnership with system partners, we have delivered a new model of intermediate care within existing workforce, funding and organisational arrangements. This demonstrates that innovation in partnership is possible even with constrained resources.

#### Strategic Benefits We Expect

- **Service Efficiency:** Reduced duplication, improved coordination, better use of resources
- **Patient Experience:** Seamless care journey across organisational boundaries
- **System Learning:** Access to best practices and innovations across partnership
- **Preventive Impact:** Early intervention possibilities when whole-system view is available

#### Challenges to Manage

Integration is complex work:

- Multiple organisations with different cultures, histories, and ways of working
- Governance complexity—how do we make decisions fairly and quickly?
- Data sharing requires robust agreements respecting privacy and information governance
- Financial integration and risk-sharing arrangements need careful management
- Competing organisational priorities may surface

#### Critical Success Factors

- Clear governance structures and decision-making processes that all partners understand
- Aligned performance metrics that reflect shared outcomes, not just organisational targets
- Robust data sharing agreements that enable learning without compromising privacy
- Adequate investment in integration infrastructure and supporting roles
- Regular review and adaptation of partnership arrangements

#### Risks to Monitor

- Integration efforts may consume significant resources without delivering expected benefits if not well-managed
- Organisational autonomy concerns may limit how deeply we can integrate
- Competing priorities across partners could slow progress
- Data silos may persist despite good intentions if infrastructure is inadequate
- We must maintain focus on patient benefit, not organisational convenience

---

### 5. Service Efficiency & Innovation

#### What The Priority Means

The 10-Year Plan emphasises improving productivity and service quality through standardisation, innovation in service delivery and care models, and adoption of appropriate technology. This priority recognises a reality: we must deliver high quality care with constrained resources, requiring us to work differently and smarter.

#### Our Strategic Response

We are committed to three interconnected goals:

1. **Innovate** in service delivery—testing new approaches to care
2. **Standardise** processes for consistency and efficiency—learning what works and spreading it
3. **Build capability** across the organisation—developing our people and infrastructure

**Our Focus:** High quality, safe, effective care delivery that serves our communities well

#### Why This Matters

- We must reverse corporate cost growth and improve productivity
- Standardisation can improve consistency across our services, reducing unwarranted variation
- Innovation may enable new service models that reach more people with constrained resources
- Our patients expect we use the best available approaches and technologies

#### Innovation Opportunities We Are Exploring

- **Digital Transformation:** Telehealth, electronic records, remote monitoring
- **New Workforce Models:** Therapists, practitioners, apprenticeships—using skills creatively
- **Service Redesign:** Care pathways that reflect what patients actually need
- **Technology Adoption:** Artificial intelligence, diagnostic innovation, data analytics

#### Honest Assessment of Challenges

We acknowledge the tensions inherent in this priority:

- **Financial Pressure:** We must reduce costs whilst maintaining quality—this is genuinely difficult
- **Workforce Capacity:** Limited capacity for change management when teams are already stretched
- **Technology Investment:** Requires upfront capital investment and ongoing technical support
- **Change Resistance:** Our people may reasonably worry about impacts of new operating models
- **Risk of Unintended Consequences:** Innovation sometimes creates unexpected problems

#### What Success Requires

- Leadership commitment that is visible and consistent
- Staff engagement in redesign process—our people have insights about what will work
- Adequate change management resources and expertise
- Phased implementation that allows learning and adjustment
- Celebration of innovations that work, with honest learning from those that don't

#### Risks to Monitor

- Cost-cutting could compromise service quality if we are not careful and vigilant
- Innovation initiatives may fail despite good intentions
- Technology implementation may be delayed or over-budget
- We must maintain morale and engagement of our people during change
- Focus on efficiency must not overshadow our commitment to compassionate care

## Critical Challenges We Must Address

We are open and honest and do what we say we will. That commitment requires us to acknowledge the significant challenges that sit alongside our strategic opportunities.

### 1. Financial Constraints – High Priority

#### The Challenge

Leeds Community Healthcare faces significant financial challenges that constrain our strategic options and limit our capacity for workforce investment. This is not unique to us—the whole NHS system is experiencing financial pressures—but it affects what we can do.

**Specific Pressures:**
- Need to reverse corporate cost growth
- Redesign roles and structures to improve efficiency
- Find savings whilst maintaining service quality
- Limited flexibility for new investments

#### Impact on Our People

These constraints affect the choices available to us:
- Limited capacity to invest in workforce development initiatives that we know would help
- Potential need to freeze recruitment in some areas, even where vacancies exist
- May need to deprioritise innovation projects that would improve services
- Could impact staff morale and retention if not communicated transparently

#### What We Will Do

- Develop detailed, realistic cost-reduction roadmap with staff involvement
- Identify quick-win efficiency projects that improve quality whilst reducing costs
- Communicate financial situation transparently and honestly to our people
- Explore alternative funding sources for key priorities
- Monitor impact carefully and adjust if unintended consequences emerge

#### What We Will Monitor

- Monthly financial performance against budget
- Staffing levels by service and specialty
- Service quality metrics—we will not trade away quality for savings
- Staff turnover rates and exit interviews—are people leaving because of financial pressures?
- Staff satisfaction and wellbeing, particularly in high-pressure areas

---

### 2. Workforce Shortages & Competition – Medium-High Priority

#### The Challenge

The healthcare sector is experiencing significant national recruitment challenges that affect our ability to attract and retain talented people. This is a system-wide issue, not unique to community healthcare, but it has real implications for us.

**National Context:**
- Some specialties are particularly affected: Mental health, community nursing, allied health professions
- Turnover rates of 15% nationally (above the target of less than 12%)
- Vacancy rates around 11% nationally, some regions higher
- Limited training pipeline in some specialties

**LCH-Specific Challenges:**
- Competition with larger NHS trusts who may offer more attractive terms
- Community healthcare can be less visible than hospital-based roles
- Some specialties have particularly high turnover—we must understand why and address root causes
- May struggle to attract people early in their careers who might prefer hospital experience

#### Impact for Our Services and People

- Difficulty filling critical vacancies affects service quality
- Increased reliance on temporary staffing is expensive and disruptive
- Our people experience burnout from workload pressures when teams are under-resourced
- New starters may feel unsupported if teams are stretched
- Experienced staff feel exhausted trying to maintain quality with insufficient colleagues

#### What We Will Do

- Conduct skills audit to identify critical gaps and priority specialties
- Develop local recruitment pipelines through apprenticeships and training
- Improve working conditions and flexibility where possible
- Create clear career development pathways—people should see a future with us
- Build regional partnerships for talent sharing

---

### 4. External Factors Beyond Our Control – Medium Priority

#### The Challenge

Health inequalities and many health determinants have root causes substantially outside healthcare's control. If we commit to reducing health inequalities—which we do—we must acknowledge this reality and work with it strategically.

**Social Determinants of Health:**
- Housing quality, accessibility, affordability, stability
- Employment availability, wages, working conditions
- Educational attainment and health literacy
- Economic conditions—poverty, income inequality
- Environmental factors—air quality, transportation, community safety

#### Impact

- We cannot solve health inequalities through healthcare alone
- Success requires multi-sector partnerships and systemic change
- Progress is difficult to measure in short term
