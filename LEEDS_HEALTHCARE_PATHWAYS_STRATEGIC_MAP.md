# Leeds Healthcare Pathways: Strategic Planning Map 2025-2031

**Purpose:** Visual representation of service user journeys and integrated care pathways across Leeds healthcare system informed by 2025/26 NHS operational planning and new strategic guidance

**Date:** 2025-10-22 (Updated with new documentation)

**Scope:** LTHT, LCH, LYPFT within West Yorkshire ICS framework, aligned to NHS 10-year plan, neighbourhood health guidance, and operational planning frameworks

**Key Update:** Reflects mandatory three-shift transformation framework and neighbourhood health model requirements

---

## SECTION 1: THE THREE MANDATORY STRATEGIC SHIFTS (2025-2031)

All pathways must now reflect these explicit transformations:

### SHIFT 1: HOSPITAL TO COMMUNITY
```
THEN (2024):                          NOW (2025+):
Hospital-led referral pathways   →    Community-first assessment
Acute = primary site              →    Home/neighbourhood = primary site
Community = follow-up                  Acute = when clinically necessary only
```

**Leeds Implementation:**
- ✓ HomeFirst program operational (discharge coordination)
- ✓ 6 neighbourhood health teams with proactive function
- **RISK:** LTHT expanding electives (forecasting more referrals) while LCH already at capacity
  - Impact: Discharge bottleneck will worsen
  - Missing: Joint capacity plan documented

### SHIFT 2: TREATMENT TO PREVENTION
```
THEN (2024):                          NOW (2025+):
Reactive emergency care           →    Proactive early identification
Hospital admission = trigger           Risk stratification = trigger
Care starts after crisis                Care starts before crisis
```

**Leeds Implementation:**
- ✓ Health & Care Academy expanding prevention training (uptake increasing)
- ✓ Five population health boards established with equity lens
- **GAP:** Social care engagement weak (~10% participation vs 1/3 of workforce)
- **Impact:** Prevention pathway incomplete without social care

### SHIFT 3: ANALOGUE TO DIGITAL
```
THEN (2024):                          NOW (2025+):
Paper referrals, separate systems  →   Digital-first pathways
Manual coordination                →    AI-enabled risk stratification
Multiple access points            →    Single patient record, integrated systems
```

**Leeds Implementation:**
- ✓ Digital discovery completed (100+ stakeholder sessions)
- ✗ Final digital strategy delayed (awaiting NHS England structural clarity)
- **BOTTLENECK:** Digital enablement of pathways blocked; timelines slipping
- **Impact:** Single Point of Access, virtual wards, community diagnostic routing cannot be operationalized without digital foundation

## SECTION 2: NEIGHBOURHOOD HEALTH MODEL - 6 MANDATORY COMPONENTS

NHS England mandates all Integrated Care Systems implement by March 2026:

### Component A: Proactive Community-Based Care
```
What it is:     Early identification of people at risk
                Outreach to vulnerable populations
                Home assessment/monitoring

Leeds status:   HomeFirst program operating; some prevention outreach

Staffing:       LCH neighbourhood teams (6 areas)
                Health & Care Academy engaged

Bottleneck:     Staff sickness 10%+ in some services
                Cannot expand without addressing absence crisis
```

### Component B: Step-Up / Step-Down Intermediate Care
```
What it is:     Short-term support to avoid hospital admission
                Post-discharge rehabilitation at home
                Rapid response to acute changes

Leeds status:   HomeFirst framework exists; intermediate care available

Bottleneck:     CRITICAL CAPACITY MISMATCH
                - LTHT expanding electives
                - LCH projected to receive more referrals
                - No joint capacity model documented
                - If LCH full, can't discharge LTHT patients
                - Creates hospital bed blocking
```

### Component C: Specialist Input to Teams
```
What it is:     LTHT consultants/specialists support neighbourhood teams
                Remote advice, rapid assessment, specialty protocols

Leeds status:   Framework exists (place-based boards)

Bottleneck:     No documented specialty-specific protocols
                Unclear how LTHT consultants access LCH teams
                No clear escalation pathways
```

### Component D: Urgent Neighbourhood Services (Single Point of Access)
```
What it is:     One unified entry point (phone/digital)
                Routes to: virtual ward, urgent treatment centre,
                           same-day emergency centre, ED, community assessment

Leeds status:   NOT OPERATIONALIZED
                - 111, GPs, ED, ambulance exist separately
                - No single coordinated access

Timeline:       Mandatory operational by March 2026
                Implementation plan due December 2025

Bottleneck:     Digital enablement required (not yet available)
                Staffing for SPOA not planned
                Technology links between systems unclear
```

### Component E: Data Integration & Risk Stratification
```
What it is:     Single patient record across all services
                AI-enabled identification of high-risk individuals
                Shared decision-making with patient

Leeds status:   Single Care Record launched (limited functionality)
                Digital discovery complete

Bottleneck:     Final digital strategy DELAYED
                - Awaiting NHS England clarity on structure
                - Information governance agreements incomplete
                - Risk stratification tools not deployed

Timeline:       Strategy completion delayed beyond Q3 2025
```

### Component F: Care Coordination Function
```
What it is:     Named coordinator for complex patients
                Orchestrates across LTHT, LCH, LYPFT, social care
                Patient-centered care planning

Leeds status:   LCH teams have coordinators
                HomeFirst demonstrates working example

Bottleneck:     Cross-organizational protocols MISSING
                - No documented LCH-LTHT coordination standards
                - No LCH-LYPFT mental health integration protocol
                - Gaps between discharge and follow-up care

Impact:         Patients fall between organizations
                Discharge delays when coordination breaks
```

---

## SECTION 3: THREE NEW MANDATORY PATHWAY TYPES

### Pathway Type 1: Virtual Wards (Hospital at Home)
```
Entry:          Patient with acute exacerbation (COPD, heart failure, etc.)
                Avoids hospital admission

Process:        Remote monitoring (vital signs, O2 sats via device)
                Daily virtual clinician contact
                Pharmacy support, rapid escalation if needed

Leeds Status:   MANDATORY by 2025/26
                Implementation detail NOT documented

Bottleneck:     Device procurement, training, integration with ED
                IT infrastructure for remote monitoring
                Staffing models unclear

Workforce Impact: New roles needed
                - Virtual ward clinician (nurse/doctor)
                - Remote monitoring technician
                - Device support/patient education
```

### Pathway Type 2: Single Point of Access (SPOA)
```
Entry:          Patient needs urgent care
                Phone: 111 or SPOA direct number
                Digital: NHS App or online form

Decision Point: Senior clinical decision-maker assesses
                Routes to:
                ├─ Virtual ward (if suitable for home care)
                ├─ SPOA appointment (face-to-face assessment)
                ├─ UTC (Urgent Treatment Centre)
                ├─ SDEC (Same-Day Emergency Centre)
                ├─ ED (if life-threatening)
                └─ Community assessment (if low acuity)

Leeds Status:   OPERATIONALIZING for urgent care
                Ambulance service has senior clinical decision-makers at SPOA

Missing:        Full operational model documentation
                Primary care/public integration unclear
                Digital linkages incomplete

Timeline:       Operational by March 2026
                Design completion needed by December 2025
```

### Pathway Type 3: Community Diagnostic Centres
```
What:           Imaging, pathology, physiology tests in community
                Avoids hospital outpatient attendance
                Results directly to GP

Purpose:        Reduce elective waiting times
                Faster diagnosis in community

Capacity:       NHS target: >1 per Integrated Care System by March 2025
                170 nationally by March 2025

Leeds Status:   West Yorkshire allocation unclear in available documents
                Integration with neighbourhood teams NOT detailed

Bottleneck:     Unclear how routes from community to LCH to LTHT
                Who manages waiting lists?
                Which tests available vs. only major imaging/pathology?
```

---

## SECTION 4: POPULATION-SEGMENTED PATHWAYS (Not One Size Fits All)

Instead of single pathway design, five distinct flows by population need:

### Population 1: Children & Young People (0-18)
```
Key Health Issues:
  - Respiratory disease (higher in deprived areas)
  - Neurodevelopmental conditions (autism, ADHD)
  - Mental health/anxiety

CRITICAL BOTTLENECK:
  - Pre-school Neurodevelopment (PND) Assessment Crisis
  - Current: 2,160 children waiting 65+ weeks for assessment
  - Impact: Entering school undiagnosed
  - Cost: £700k investment needed
  - Timeline: 3+ years to clear backlog without investment

Pathway Flow:
  Parent concern → GP assessment → Referral to PND service
                                        ↓
                                  [BLOCKED: 65+ weeks]
                                        ↓
                                  Child enters school undiagnosed
                                        ↓
                                  School reports difficulties
                                        ↓
                                  Second referral (older child)
                                        ↓
                                  Further 65+ week wait

Equity Issue: Worse outcomes in deprived areas
  - Access barriers: transport, time off work, childcare
  - Even with intervention (Access LCH program), improvement 5% vs 8% in less-deprived areas

Solution Needed: Dedicated PND service investment + community-based assessment capacity
```

### Population 2: Older People with Frailty (65+)
```
Key Health Issues:
  - Falls risk
  - Multiple chronic conditions
  - Loss of independence/function

Pathway Flow (Working Model - HomeFirst):
  Risk identification (GP, practice nurse screening)
                ↓
          Fall prevention intervention (home assessment, hazards removed, exercise)
                ↓
          Acute event (fall, illness, hospital admission)
                ↓
          [2-hour emergency response - LCH available]
                ↓
          LTHT assessment if major injury/acute illness
                ↓
          Hospital treatment (days-weeks)
                ↓
          Discharge decision (medical review, capability assessment)
                ↓
          HomeFirst coordination → Community rehabilitation
                ↓
          Return to independence at home

Bottleneck: Continence Service
  - Capacity constrained due to sickness absence
  - "Long-standing capacity gaps due to long-term sickness" (LCH Board)
  - Continence is step-up service; if full, other patients back up
  - Bladder/bowel patients create longer stays

Risk: Re-admission
  - Frail older people re-admitted if discharge support inadequate
  - Special risk: Dementia patients (see Population 3)

Equity Issue: Slightly better outcomes than deprived populations
  - But still IMD 1 shows worse outcomes on average stay length
```

### Population 3: People with Dementia
```
Key Health Issues:
  - Cognitive decline
  - Behavioral/psychiatric symptoms
  - Higher risk of injury, poor self-care

Distinctive Finding:
  - 2x more likely to access intermediate care (higher utilization)
  - HIGHER RE-ADMISSION RATES POST-DISCHARGE
  - Suggests discharge plan inadequate

Pathway Problem Area:
  Hospital discharge → [Should go to LCH for rehab]
                           ↓
                     [If adequate support available]
                           ↓
                     Remains at home with carer support
                           ↓
                     [If carer stressed/unprepared]
                           ↓
                     Re-admission to hospital within weeks

Equity Issue: Disproportionately in IMD 1
  - Carers less able to cope (working multiple jobs, no access to respite)
  - Worse outcomes in deprived areas

Workforce Need: Dementia specialist coordinators
  - Carer assessment and support
  - Behavioral management training
  - Discharge planning specific to dementia needs
```

### Population 4: End-of-Life Care
```
Key Health Issues:
  - Terminal illness management
  - Symptom control (pain, breathlessness, nausea)
  - Carer support, grief counseling

Scale: 4th highest bed day use in Leeds system
       Highest rate per 1,000 population

Pathway: Hospice integration model
         Disease progression → Community palliative care
                                  ↓
                           [Hospice referral if preferred by patient]
                           [LTHT palliative team if hospital-based]
                                  ↓
                           Comfort-focused care
                                  ↓
                           Bereavement support

Equity Issue: Underexplored in documents
             Likely worse outcomes in IMD 1 (less access to hospice, less planning)

Staffing Gap: Unclear how LCH coordinates with hospices
```

### Population 5: Mental Health Crisis
```
Key Entry Points:
  - ED attendance (high-intensity users identified)
  - 111 call
  - Community mental health team
  - Self-referral/carer referral

Pathway Flow:
  Crisis event → LYPFT crisis team assessment (24/7 availability)
                        ↓
            ┌───────────┼───────────┐
            ↓           ↓           ↓

            └───────────┼───────────┘
                        ↓
            Recovery & discharge planning
                        ↓
        Community follow-up (CMHT), GP coordination

Bottleneck: Out-of-Area Placements
  - When no local crisis bed available
  - Patients discharged 50+ miles from home
  - Separation from family/carers impacts recovery
  - LYPFT actively reducing but documented as ongoing issue

ED Overuse Issue:
  - High-intensity ED users identified as problematic
  - No specific pathway redesign documented to reduce ED use
  - Suggests crisis pathway not fully effective

LYPFT Agency Challenge:
  - 4% of payroll (target 3%) = £8.4M annual cost
  - Reason: Can't recruit consultant psychiatrists
  - Creates reliance on temporary staff (continuity issues)

Workforce Need: Specialist mental health practitioners, peer support workers
```

---

## SECTION 5: EQUITY-BASED PATHWAY ROUTING - THE DEPRIVATION LENS

**Critical Finding:** All five populations show worse outcomes in IMD 1 (most deprived 10%)

### The Deprivation Reality
```
Population Size:
  - 26% of Leeds population in IMD 1 (226,000 people)
  - 34% of children in deprived areas

Healthcare Access Barriers (Documented):
  ✗ Transport (no car, poor public transport)
  ✗ Finance (can't afford time off work, travel costs)
  ✗ Employment (shift work, can't get time off for appointments)
  ✗ Caring responsibilities (children, elderly parents)
  ✗ Communication (digital/language barriers)

Outcome Disparities (Documented):
  ✗ Waiting times: Growing gap (IMD 1 waits longer than others)
  ✗ Young frailty: Earlier onset of frailty in IMD 1
  ✗ Dementia: Higher re-admission rates in IMD 1
  ✗ Children respiratory: Higher prevalence in IMD 1
  ✗ Respiratory all ages: Longer length of stay in IMD 1
  ✗ Intermediate care: Higher utilization in IMD 1 (42% of patients)

Intervention Effectiveness (Critical Gap):
  - Access LCH initiative to reduce waiting lists
  - Result: 8% reduction in IMD 2-10
  - Result: 5% reduction in IMD 1 (WORSE)
  - Conclusion: Standard interventions not working for deprived populations
```

### Current Equity Response
```
✓ Identified:
  - Healthy Leeds Plan names IMD 1 as priority
  - Five population boards with equity lens established
  - Barriers explicitly documented

✗ Missing:
  - Specific routing mechanisms (do IMD 1 patients get priority appointments?)
  - Community health worker deployment to deprived wards
  - Transport-supported appointment access
  - Job-flexible appointment times
  - Targeted outreach/proactive contact
  - Deprivation-adjusted resource allocation

Needed: Explicit pathway design showing HOW inequities will reduce (not just identified)
```

### Proposed Equity-Based Pathway Principle
```
Standard Pathway (All populations):
  Symptom/risk → GP assessment → Referral → Waiting list → Appointment

Equity-Enhanced Pathway (IMD 1 focus):
  Symptom/risk → Outreach/proactive identification
                        ↓
                Community health worker (from same area)
                        ↓
                Assessment at home (no transport barrier)
                        ↓
                Appointment at flexible time (job-compatible)
                        ↓
                Transport support if needed
                        ↓
                Follow-up by same person (relationship continuity)

Cost of equity: Additional staffing, transport, time
Benefit of equity: Earlier intervention, better outcomes, reduced admissions
```

---

## SECTION 6: SYSTEM INTEGRATION POINTS & COORDINATION MECHANISMS

### Governance Structure
```
STRATEGIC LAYER:
  West Yorkshire ICB → Sets overall direction & resource allocation

PLACE LAYER:
  Leeds Place-Based Board + Health & Care Partnership
  └─ 5 Population Health Boards (equity lens)
  └─ Team Leeds (HomeFirst operational delivery)
  └─ Health & Care Academy (workforce development)

OPERATIONAL LAYER:
  LTHT ↔ LCH ↔ LYPFT ↔ Primary Care ↔ Social Care ↔ Voluntary Sector
  [Should be connected; currently fragmented on key issues]

MISSING LAYER:
  Pathway Governance - No centralized function reviewing all active pathways
  Result: Each pathway designed separately; no system-level coherence
```

## SECTION 7: OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS SHAPING ALL PATHWAYS

### Financial Reality: 4% + 1% Equation
```
What's Required (2025/26):
  ✓ 4% productivity improvement (more care, same resources)
  ✓ 1% cost reduction (reduce cost base)
  ✓ Absorb pay awards & inflation
  ✓ Absorb NI increases

Result:
  ✗ REAL TERMS REDUCTION to service delivery capacity
  ✗ Cannot add neighbourhood health without removing something else
  ✗ Digital investment deferred (expensive upfront)
  ✗ Workforce development pathways constrained
  ✗ PND investment gap (£700k) cannot be funded

Impact on Pathways:
  - Elective waiting list target: 5% point improvement required
  - Current LCH position: 24.8% seen within 18 weeks (target 65%)
  - Gap: 40.2 percentage points = 2,160+ additional patients need to be seen
  - With reduced budget? Mathematically impossible without investment
```

### Workforce Constraints
```
Recruitment Crisis:
  - Medical recruitment freeze (NHS England policy)
  - International recruitment ceiling (10% of total workforce)
  - LYPFT agency spend 4% (target 3%); £8.4M annual cost
  - Cannot reduce without solving consultant psychiatrist recruitment

Sickness Absence:
  - LCH services at 10%+ absence in some areas
  - Continence service: "long-standing capacity gaps due to sickness"
  - Effect: When LCH staff absent, can't discharge LTHT patients
  - Creates hospital bed blocking cycle

Skills Gaps (2025-31 Required):
  ✗ Care coordination (across organizational boundaries)
  ✗ Population health / early identification
  ✗ Digital tools / AI-enabled pathways
  ✗ Deprivation-aware practice
  ✗ System-level leadership
  ✓ Prevention skills (Academy expanding, good uptake)

## SECTION 8: CRITICAL PATHWAY GAPS REQUIRING CLOSURE BY DECEMBER 2025

### Gap 1: Acute-Community Capacity Plan
```
What's Missing:
  - Joint LTHT-LCH capacity projection
  - Response plan for expanded electives
  - Discharge target timeline
  - Resource commitment

Why Critical:
  - LTHT forecasting more referrals
  - LCH already has 2,160 children waiting 65+ weeks
  - If no plan, discharge delays will intensify
  - Hospital crowding will increase
  - ED waiting times will worsen
  - Elective targets will slip

Deadline: Should be in Joint Forward Plan (December 2025)
```

### Gap 2: Single Point of Access Implementation
```
What's Missing:
  - Operational model detail
  - Staffing requirements
  - Technology/digital integration plan
  - Training curriculum
  - Performance metrics

Why Critical:
  - Mandatory by March 2026
  - Current: 111, GPs, ED separate (patients confused about access)
  - Design needed immediately to procure/train by March
  - Delays digital pathway enablement further

Timeline: Implementation plan needed by December 2025
```

### Gap 3: Care Coordination Cross-Organizational Standards
```
What's Missing:
  - Written protocols for LCH-LTHT coordination
  - Written protocols for LCH-LYPFT coordination
  - Standards for: referral, assessment, discharge planning, follow-up
  - Accountability (who is responsible if things slip?)

Why Critical:
  - Patients fall between organizations currently
  - Discharge delays caused by unclear accountability
  - HomeFirst works because designed; most pathways aren't

Timeline: Needed before pathways can be effectively integrated
```

### Gap 4: Deprivation-Adjusted Pathway Routing
```
What's Missing:
  - Explicit design showing HOW waiting time gaps will reduce
  - Community health worker deployment plans
  - Transport support/job-flexible appointment design
  - Outreach/proactive identification protocols
  - Resource allocation (equity surpluses for high-need areas)

Why Critical:
  - IMD 1 outcomes deteriorating, not improving
  - Current interventions (Access LCH) not working (5% vs 8% improvement)
  - Health inequalities growing
  - Violates equity commitments

Timeline: Should be in Healthy Leeds Plan implementation (ongoing)
```

### Gap 5: Social Care Integration Agreement
```
What's Missing:
  - Formal integration of social care into neighbourhood health
  - Social care representation on pathway governance
  - Joint funding/commissioning models
  - Training pathways for social care workforce

Why Critical:
  - 1/3 of workforce is social care
  - Only ~10% training participation
  - Discharge pathways incomplete without social care input
  - Prevention pathway can't start without social care assessment

Timeline: Needed to enable neighbourhood health component F (care coordination)
```

### Gap 6: PND Service Investment
```
What's Missing:
  - Funding source for £700k investment
  - Staffing expansion plan
  - Community-based assessment capacity design
  - Timeline for clearing backlog

Why Critical:
  - 2,160+ children waiting 65+ weeks
  - Early intervention pathway broken
  - Without investment: 3+ year trajectory to clear
  - Creates generation of undiagnosed children entering school

Timeline: Investment decision needed by December 2025
```

## SECTION 9: SUMMARY - PATHWAYS BY READINESS STATUS

### Green (Ready/Operational)
```
✓ Elective care pathway (traditional model)
✓ Emergency care pathway (ED-led)
✓ Mental health crisis pathway (LYPFT)
✓ HomeFirst discharge pathway (proven model)
✓ Prevention training pathway (Academy)
```

### Yellow (Partially Ready / Designed but Not Fully Operationalized)
```
~ Neighbourhood health model (6 components, not all functional)
~ Frailty prevention pathway (framework exists, staffing gaps)
~ Community diagnostic centres (infrastructure exists, integration unclear)
~ Digital pathways (discovery done, strategy delayed)
```

### Red (Not Ready / Design Phase or Missing)
```
✗ Virtual wards (Hospital at Home) - no operational detail
✗ Single Point of Access (SPOA) - not operationalized
✗ Care coordination across organizations - no protocols
✗ Deprivation-adjusted routing - not designed
✗ Neurodevelopmental assessment pathway - BLOCKED (waiting list crisis)
✗ Mental health community pathway - capacity constrained (out-of-area placements)
✗ Post-discharge monitoring (dementia) - producing re-admissions
```

## SECTION 10: KEY DATES & CRITICAL DECISIONS NEEDED

```
DECEMBER 2025 (Delivery Plans Due):
  □ Neighbourhood health model delivery plans (all 6 components)
  □ Acute-community capacity agreement
  □ Single Point of Access operational model
  □ Digital strategy completion
  □ Care coordination protocols
  □ PND investment decision

MARCH 2026 (Mandatory Implementation):
  □ Neighbourhood health operational (all components)
  □ Single Point of Access live
  □ Virtual wards operational
  □ Community diagnostic centres integrated

APRIL 2027 (Structural Change):
  □ Specialized commissioning transfer (staff moves to ICB)
  □ Care quality impact unknown (new commissioning model)

2026-2031 (Strategic Trajectory):
  ↓ Hospital to Community fully embedded
  ↓ Prevention as standard (not exception)
  ↓ Digital-first pathways default
  ↓ Elective pathways transformed (direct access, patient choice via NHS App)
  ↓ Health inequalities narrowed (IMD 1 = IMD 10 outcomes)
```

## RECOMMENDATIONS: WORKFORCE IMPLICATIONS

### Immediate Skills/Roles Needed (Next 6 months)
```
1. Care coordinators with cross-organizational authority
2. Community health workers for outreach (especially IMD 1)
3. Single Point of Access staff (urgent services routing)
4. Virtual ward clinicians (remote monitoring clinical lead)
5. Digital pathway specialists (HealthStore implementation)
```

### Medium-Term Development (2026-2027)
```
1. System leadership programs (managing cross-organization change)
2. Neighbourhood health team leaders (integration skills)
3. Deprivation-aware practice training (all staff)
4. Advanced care coordination (complex cases)
5. Social care pathway workers (bridging primary-secondary)
```

### Strategic (2027-2031)
```
1. Specialist primary care practitioners (advanced assessment)
2. Community diagnostic technicians (imaging, pathology at home)
3. Population health analysts (AI-enabled risk stratification)
4. Patient navigators (equity-focused access support)
5. Integration/change managers (new pathway implementation)
```

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Funding**: £700k for PND alone; broader investment needed for pathway transformation
2. **Staffing**: Must solve sickness absence and recruitment; pathways can't flow with gaps
3. **Digital**: Strategy completion essential; pathways blocked without it
4. **Coordination**: Governance structure exists but must enforce accountability
5. **Equity**: Deprivation-adjusted design non-negotiable; current gaps growing
